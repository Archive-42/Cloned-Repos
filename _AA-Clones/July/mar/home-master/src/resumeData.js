    "bio1": `Computers have always been a part of my life. I started building them when I was 10 years old and my fascination only grew from there. In high school, I taught myself AutoCAD and sought out engineering competitions by starting a group or entering solo. As a young adult, I loved working in IT due to the problem solving that I was challenged by on a regular basis.`,
    
    "bio2": `In college, my trajectory shifted to a more inward journey where I studied psychology. That lead me to Five Element Acupuncture, where my primary focus was on self-awareness and emotional intelligence.`,
    
    "bio3": `Searching for something that challenged me more, I put together a list of qualities that I thrive in and worked to find a career that checked them all off. That is when I discovered my passion of software engineering. Attending App Academy could not have been a better choice to empower me towards sharpening my skills in JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, Node.js, Sequelize, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML5, and CSS3.`,
