# To-Do Item Command Line Utility

Use this starter project to complete the object-oriented programming project
**OOPS! I Forgot a Thing**. It contains a fully-functional UI, that is, the
input handling and screen transitions all appropriately work.

Run this program using the command `node program.js`. Type CTRL+C to abort the
program. You can also follow the prompts and it will properly exit.

In **application.js** and all of the JavaScript files that end in _-screen_,
there are comments marked with "// TODO:". In each of the _-screen_ files, there
are very specific instructions about what your code must do to make the UI
correctly work. In **application.js**, there are less specific instructions
because that is the object-oriented programming that you must perform.
