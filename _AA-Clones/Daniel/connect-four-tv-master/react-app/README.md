This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Your React App will live here.  While is development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.

This app will be automatically built when you deploy to heroku, please see the `heroku-postbuild` script in your `express.js` applications `package.json` to see how this works.
