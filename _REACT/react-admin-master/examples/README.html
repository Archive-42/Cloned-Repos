<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>If you’d like to contribute example applications, you’ll likely use <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to initialize your example by running <code>create-react-app myexample</code> directly in this directory. This is because <code>create-react-app</code> does not work yet with yarn workspaces and lerna. There is a workaround though:</p>
<p>Initialize your new example application outside of react-admin folder then simply move the newly created folder inside the <code>examples</code> folder. Finally, run <code>yarn</code> at the react-admin root folder.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure you don’t commit a <code>yarn.lock</code> inside your new example application folder.</p>
