WebAppModernJS
==============

This repository contains the project code for the 'Web Application Development with Modern JavaScript' workshop run by the London Academy of IT.

The project is a party-planning app with just a couple of simple features (for now). We look forward to adding new features created by our students - make sure to let us know if you've built something.
