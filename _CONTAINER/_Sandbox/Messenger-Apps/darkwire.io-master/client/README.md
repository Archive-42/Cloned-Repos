# Darkwire Client

This is the client for [Darkwire](https://github.com/darkwire/darkwire.io). It requires [darkwire-server](../server) in order to run.

## Translations

Translation strings are pulled from JSON files in [this directory](https://github.com/darkwire/darkwire.io/tree/master/client/src/i18n). We welcome pull requests to add support for more lanuages. For native speakers, it should take only a few minutes to translate the site.

Please see [this PR](https://github.com/darkwire/darkwire.io/pull/95) for an example of what your translation PR should look like.

Thank you for your contributions!
