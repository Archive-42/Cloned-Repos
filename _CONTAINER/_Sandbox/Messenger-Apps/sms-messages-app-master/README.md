# Web and Twilio powered SMS Messages app

This is an implementation of an SMS Messages app that you can use with a [Twilio](https://twilio.com) number.

## Warning

This is a work in progress as there are plenty of features to add. Currently the application does the following:

* Lists messages sent to your Twilio number (inbox)
* Lists messages sent from your Twilio number (outbox)
* Conversation view of messages between your Twilio number and another number
* Reply to a conversation
* Create a new message to a new recipient

## Getting started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/philnash/sms-messages-app.git
$ cd sms-messages-app
$ npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the your Twilio account credentials and the Twilio number you want to use. You can find your Account SID and Auth Token in your [Twilio account portal](https://www.twilio.com/user/account).

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then start the application:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will see the application.
