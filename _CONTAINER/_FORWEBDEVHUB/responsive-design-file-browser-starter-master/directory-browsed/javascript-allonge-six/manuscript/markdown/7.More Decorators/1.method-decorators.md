## Stateful Method Decorators {#stateful-method-decorators}

As noted in [Method Decorators](#method-decorators), and again in [Symmetry, Colour, and Charm](#symmetry), simple function decorators work and work well for ordinary functions. But in JavaScript, functions can be invoked in different ways, and some of those ways are slightly incompatible with each other.

Of great interest to us are *methods* in JavaScript, functions that are used to define the behaviour of instances. When a function is invoked as a method, the name `this` is bound to the instance, and most methods rely on that binding to work properly.

Consider, for example the simple decorator `requireAll`, that raises an exception if a function is invoked without at least as many arguments as declared parameters:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const requireAll = (fn) =>
  function (...args) {
    if (args.length < fn.length)
      throw new Error('missing required arguments');
    else
      return fn(...args);
  }
~~~~~~~~

`requireAll` works perfectly with ordinary functions, what we called "blue" invocations. But if we want to use `requireAll` with methods, we have to write it in such a way that it preserves `this` when it invokes the underlying function:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const requireAll = (fn) =>
  function (...args) {
    if (args.length < fn.length)
      throw new Error('missing required arguments');
    else
      return fn.apply(this, args);
  }
~~~~~~~~

It now works properly, including ignoring invocations that do not pass all the arguments. But you have to be very careful when writing higher-order functions to make sure they work as both function decorators and as method decorators.

We called this style of decorator a "green" decorator, because it handles blue (ordinary function) and yellow (method) invocations.

### the problem with state

Handling `this` properly is not the only way in which ordinary function decorators differ from method decorators. Some decorators are stateful, like `once`. Here's a version that correctly sets `this`:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const once = (fn) => {
  let hasRun = false;

  return function (...args) {
    if (hasRun) return;
    hasRun = true;
    return fn.apply(this, args);
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Imagining for a moment that we wish to only allow a person to have their name set once, we might write:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const once = (fn) => {
  let hasRun = false;

  return function (...args) {
    if (hasRun) return;
    hasRun = true;
    return fn.apply(this, args);
  }
}

class Person {
  setName (first, last) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    return this;
  }
  fullName () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

Object.defineProperty(Person.prototype, 'setName', { value: once(Person.prototype.setName) });

const logician = new Person()
                   .setName('Raymond', 'Smullyan')
                   .setName('Haskell', 'Curry');

logician.fullName()
  //=> Raymond Smullyan
~~~~~~~~

As we expect, only the first call to `.setName` has any effect, and it works on a method. But there is a subtle bug that could easily evade naÃ¯ve attempts to write unit tests:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const logician = new Person()
                   .setName('Raymond', 'Smullyan');

const musician = new Person()
                   .setName('Miles', 'Davis');

logician.fullName()
  //=> Raymond Smullyan

musician.fullName()
  //=> Raymond Smullyan
~~~~~~~~

!?!?!?!

What has happened here is that when we write `Object.defineProperty(Person.prototype, 'setName', { value: once(Person.prototype.setName) });`, we wrapped a function bound to `Person.prototype`. That function is shared between all instances of `Person`. That's deliberate, it's the whole point of prototypical inheritance (and the "class-based inheritance" JavaScript builds with prototypes).

Since our `once` decorator returns a decorated function with private state (the `hasRun` variable), all the instances share the same private state, and thus the bug.

### writing stateful method decorators

If we don't need to use the same decorator for functions and for methods, we can rewrite our decorator to use a [WeakSet] to track whether a method has been invoked for an instance:

[WeakSet]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const once = (fn) => {
  let invocations = new WeakSet();

  return function (...args) {
    if (invocations.has(this)) return;
    invocations.add(this);
    return fn.apply(this, args);
  }
}

const logician = new Person()
                   .setName('Raymond', 'Smullyan');

logician.setName('Haskell', 'Curry');

const musician = new Person()
                   .setName('Miles', 'Davis');

logician.fullName()
  //=> Raymond Smullyan

musician.fullName()
  //=> Miles Davis
~~~~~~~~

Now each instance stores whether `.setName` has been invoked on each instance a `WeakSet`, so `logician` and `musician` can share the method without sharing its state.

### incompatibility

To handle methods, we have introduced "accidental complexity" to handle `this` and to handle state. Worse, our implementation of `once` for methods won't work properly with ordinary functions in "strict" mode:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
"use strict"

const hello = once(() => 'hello!');

hello()
  //=> undefined is not an object!
~~~~~~~~

If you haven't invoked it as a method, `this` is bound to `undefined` in strict mode, and `undefined` cannot be added to a `WeakSet`.

Correcting our decorator to deal with `undefined` is straightforward:

{:lang="js"}
~~~~~~~~
const once = (fn) => {
  let invocations = new WeakSet(),
      undefinedContext = Symbol('undefined-context');

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this === undefined
                    ? undefinedContext
                    : this;
    if (invocations.has(context)) return;
    invocations.add(context);
    return fn.apply(this, args);
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

However, we're adding more accidental complexity to handle the fact that function invocation is <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, and method invocation is <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>.[^colours]

[^colours]: See the aforelinked [The Symmetry of JavaScript Functions](/2015/03/12/symmetry.html)

In the end, we can either write specialized decorators designed specifically for methods, or tolerate the additional complexity of trying to handle method invocation and function invocation in the same decorator.
