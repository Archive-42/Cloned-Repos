*JavaScript Allongé* was inspired by [The Little Schemer] by Daniel Friedman and Matthias Felleisen. But where *The Little Schemer's* primary focus is recursion, *JavaScript Allongé's* primary focus is **functions as first-class values**.

### Richard Feynman

![QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter](images/qed.jpg)

Richard Feynman's [QED] was another inspiration: A book that explains Quantum Electrodynamics and the "Sum of the Histories" methodology using the simple expedient of explaining how light reflects off a mirror, and showing how most of the things we think are happening--such as light travelling on a straight line,  the angle of reflection equalling the angle of refraction, or that a beam of light only interacts with a small portion of the mirror, or that it reflects off a plane--are all wrong. And everything is explained in simple, concise terms that build upon each other logically.
