Congratulations for attending the session for Sagarmatha Learnathon. At this point you are probably already familiar with what HTML and CSS is, how to write basic HTML and CSS, how a website is made etc. In order to complete the project we have assigned you, the content we covered in the session on Saturday might not be enough. So through this blog, we would like to link you to various learning resources for HTML and CSS.

### FreeCodeCamp ðŸ“š
FreeCodeCamp is my goto resource when I have to recommend resources for a beginner to learn anything about web development. It has detailed course on **responsive web design principles**(covers HTML, CSS and many more stuffs), **JavaScript**, **FrontEnd Libraries & Frameworks**, **ServerSide Programming with NodeJS & Express**. It also gives you project to complete after completing various sections of the learning material. For now, having a look at responsive web design section of the website would be the ideal choice for you.

Visit the website at <a href='https://freecodecamp.org' target="_blank">this link</a>.

### YouTube Videos ðŸ“¹
For a beginner, just HTML & CSS might be a lot to handle for some of the people. You have to set up a development environment, you have to know the syntax, you want to get some inspiration to continue, you need to know what projects to build. So for these situations, referring a YouTube video might be a great solution as they take you through the right path of the learning resource. Here are my few YouTube video recommendation for learning HTML and CSS. <br><br>
	<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzzGt7EmXVw&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KlJn1pMYPVV3eYzxJlWcON' target="_blank">DevTips' HTML5 Series</a><br>
	<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ONvIgOWdM&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy' target="_blank">DevTips' CSS Series</a><br>

## What should you make and how? ðŸ˜­
This might be your most serious concern at this moment and let me sort it out for you. In order to build a project you need to think what you want to make with full freedom. The next thing you can do is look at the sites which matches your project idea. 

For Example: I might want to create a social media website and for that, facebook might be the site I would refer and draw inspiration from or twitter, instagram. Problem solved? ðŸ˜„

### Dribbble
Yes, dribbble with 3 ds, didn't misspell it. This is a website where you can see people posting the User Interface of a lot of applications. You can look at one and try to copy the design on your own.
Visit dribbble at <a href='https://dribbble.com/' target='_blank'>this link</a>.

### Color Palette â­•
A beautiful website is a collection of great content, attractive images and selective matching colors. Here are my recommendation for picking colors. <br>

<a href='https://material-ui.com/customization/color/'>Material Palette</a> from google's material design principle.<br><br>
<a href='https://cloudflare.design/color/'>Cloudflare Color Picker</a> helps you to enter a website of a choice and grabs all the color used in that website. For Example: if you enter google.com in the search bar of the website, you'll get the list of all the colors used in the google's website.<br><br>
<a href='https://paletton.com/'>Paletton</a> is an interactive color picker tool which is very awesome.

### Typography ðŸ…°ðŸ…±
Choosing a graet font enhances your design. For that visit the following link <br>
<a herf='https://fonts.google.com' target='_blank'>Google fonts</a><br>

I will write a blog about including icons and fonts on the next blog. Till then, stay tuned. You'll get notified by email onces it comes out.

## My Recommendation
With all these resources to look at, you might get overwhelmed by the amount of choices you have but at the same time I also don't want you to be limited by the choices you have. So, my suggestion for you would be to go through all the resources I have mentioned and pick the best one and go all the way with it. I also want to recommend you to think small and approach the site feature by feature and not to think all at once. 

As you are just starting your web development journey, you cannot create everything that you have thought in your mind. Even the ones with a lot of experience have limitaions on their knowledge so it is very important for you to get your heads up and move slowly and piece by piece. 

## Conclusion
I hope my suggestions help you for creating the project. If you feel any inconvinence creating the project then you can always contact me at my email **prashant.acharya@sagarmatha.edu.np** or Niraj Sir's email **clickniraj12@gmail.com**.

Good luck everyone. We believe in you. We hope that you are going to make a project that will make us feel proud.
