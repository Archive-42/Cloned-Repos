    Is this my interview?
  </div>

  <p>Yes it is! In-person interviews can be stressful, lead to snap judgements, and often fail to show your competence at coding. </p>
  <p>Who the heck knows the space complexity of the radix sort algorithm off the top of their head anyway???</p>
  <p>Here at Dsco, we are trying something a little different.</p>

    What is my quest?
  </div>

  <p>You seek to add a new <code>Authors</code> feature to sit aside the existing <code>Books</code> feature.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">
    What will my quest require?
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>A new lazy-loaded <code>AuthorsModule</code> to contain the Authors feature.</li>
    <li>A new <code>AuthorsComponent</code> page that allows you to search for authors, displaying both their name &
      age.
    </li>
    <li>A new <a href="https://ngrx.io/">ngrx</a> <code>Store</code> to maintain the state for the feature.</li>
    <li>A new <code>AuthorsMocks</code> class to mock out the <code>AuthorSearchRequest</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">Where should I begin?</div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First, play around with the <code>Books</code> feature using the navbar on the left.
      <i>Note: It's generated data, so the search is pretty terrible. Try short words like "the", "he", "she".</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      To see how the books search request is mocked, go here:
      <code>projects/interview/src/app/mock/books.mocks.ts</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a href="https://ngrx.io/">ngrx</a> <code>Store</code> for the <code>Books</code> feature is here:
      <code>projects/interview/src/app/books/store</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">What if I wish to reach the Holy Grail?</div>
  <p>Although the main quest is treacherous, an experienced Angular/ngrx developer should be able to complete it in
    about 30 minutes.</p>

  <p>After this, to truly prove worthy of the Holy Grail, you may choose to embark on some side quests:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dazzle the realm at the Knights Tourney with your html/css prowess!</li>
    <li>Protect the villagers by conquering the evil TODOs.</li>
    <li>Build a bridge between <code>Authors</code> and <code>Books</code>, allowing viewing books for specific authors
      and vice-versa.
    </li>
    <li>
      Win the hearts of the kingdom by showing your character!
      Use the Holy Hand Grenade to randomly make the page blow up, leave a funny comment, brush off a few flesh wounds,
      and have fun!
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
