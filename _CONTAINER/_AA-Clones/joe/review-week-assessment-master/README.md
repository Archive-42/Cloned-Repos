# Review Assessment - Mongoose

 We're doing this primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed.  Don't stress out that we will be using this test to judge you in any way except to understand how we can better help you.

Also, we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.  Feel free to use any online resource but don't copy/paste answers to each other or if you find something similar online.

## Resources

The following resources are allowed:

* Any notes you've taken so far.
* Any code you have in your previous projects.
* learn.fullstackacademy.com.
* All the slide decks that we've used in class.

## Things we're testing

* Mongoose Model Configuration

## Starting

1. Read through the project models folder
2. Start working through the tests in `test/`.  You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
