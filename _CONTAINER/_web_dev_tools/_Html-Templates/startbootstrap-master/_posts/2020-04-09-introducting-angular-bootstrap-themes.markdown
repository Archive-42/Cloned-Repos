While continuing providing the community with quality free [Bootstrap themes](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/) and [Bootstrap templates](https://startbootstrap.com/templates/), we are now adapting some of our most popular themes to work with the Angular framework, combining the flexibility of Bootstrap with the functionality of Angular 9!

<!--more-->

By creating Angular 9 versions of some of our themes and templates, we are expanding the scope of what we do at Start Bootstrap by serving higher level developers who are looking for a better way to build out the UI of their next Angular based application or project.

Currently, we have two free to use, MIT licensed Angular 9 themes, and two pro products that use Angular 9 and Bootstrap 4 as a foundation. We also offer our two pro products bundled together for developers looking for a fully developed front end architecture for their projects.

## SB Admin Angular

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">SB Admin Angular - our first Angular based, free product</figcaption>
</figure>

Our first Bootstrap 4 template that we decided to adapt into an Angular 9 version was one of our core products, SB Admin. This template, released in 2013, has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times by visitors to Start Bootstrap, making it an obvious choice for our first foray into the world Angular templates.

With our Angular 9 implementation of SB Admin, we go beyond the basic ng-init and create an entire project structure that acts as a strong, scalable foundation for a web application. Most importantly, we use the new Ivy compiler and lazy loaded bundles to make the application lightweight and super fast.

Also, what sets SB Admin Angular apart from other open source templates is that it was developed by a high level, veteran developer with over 20 years of experience in web app development, and includes tips, tricks, and adjustments from a seasoned expert.

You can preview and download SB Admin Angular for free on Start Bootstrap. This product is MIT licensed, meaning you can use it for any purpose, even commercially!

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">SB Admin Pro Angular - our first pro product built with Angular</figcaption>
</figure>

This year at Start Bootstrap, we have also decided to move into paid, premium quality products. Our first Angular product in our premium category was SB Admin Pro Angular.

When we built this Angular 9 bootstrap theme, we had developers in mind. We expand on our free Angular 9 admin dashboard template by adding advanced features like intuitive routing and a complete navigation structure, a library of extended components and utilities built into a beautiful theme, comprehensive documentation and usage instructions, a full suite of Cypress functional tests, a web component based customizer to easily change the styling of the theme, and a variety of layout options.

SB Admin Pro Angular is available for purchase on the Start Bootstrap Shop. There are two license types available, depending on the type of application you're building.

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Clean Blog Angular / Node.js - a simple, functional blog built with Angular 9 and Node.js</figcaption>
</figure>

With our Angular 9 implementation of Clean Blog, we went a step further than our other Angular products and decided to provide users with a functional backend to create fully functional, Angular based blog applications.

This products backend, built with Node.js using TypeScript and Fastify, lets users create a fully functioning blog that allows you to create, edit, and delete blog posts using a simple, markdown based CMS after logging in with an admin password that you set in the database.

Clean Blog Angular / Node.js is also a free, MIT Licensed product, that you can use for any purpose!

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">SB UI Kit Pro Angular - a premium Angular based UI Kit</figcaption>
</figure>

Like our other pro Angular product, SB UI Kit Pro Angular uses the same project structure and development approach as our pro admin theme to give developers a massive head start when creating landing pages, marketing pages, and other front facing features within their web applications.

With a variety of landing page examples, inner page layouts, and beautifully designed, modern UI components and utilities, SB UI Kit Pro Angular is a powerhouse of a UI kit that is aimed at saving developers time and effort when designing front facing features of their web applications.

</figure>

Our Pro Angular Bundle joins the power of SB Admin Pro Angular with the tools in SB UI Kit Pro Angular to create a comprehensive product that acts as a powerful starting point for developing fully integrated modern web applications using Angular 9 and Bootstrap.

At Start Bootstrap, we focus on quality over quantity when it comes to our products, and these two products are some of the best we have ever built.

## Moving Forward

<hr class="mb-4">

We’re just hitting the tip of the iceberg regarding new technologies and alternate versions of our baseline Bootstrap based themes and templates. We have plans to create more Angular adaptations of some of our most popular themes, like SB Admin 2 or Creative, and we will be exploring new themes, and new technologies like Vue.js as the year progresses.

As always, we are always open to suggestions and would love to hear from you regarding what we should build next! We’re all ears!
