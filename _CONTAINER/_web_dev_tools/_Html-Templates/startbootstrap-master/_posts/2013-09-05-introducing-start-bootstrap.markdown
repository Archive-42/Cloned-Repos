Welcome! Thank you for visiting Start Bootstrap! My name is David Miller, owner and founder of Blackrock Digital, a digital goods company in Orlando, FL. Now that this blog is live, I’d like to take the opportunity to share a little bit about the origins of this resource for Bootstrap.

Back in Bootstrap 2 days, I had a few HTML starter templates that I would use pretty often for my own personal projects at my company. When Bootstrap 3 came around, I decided to share some of my personal Bootstrap templates on my company’s blog after updating them for Bootstrap 3. The response was pretty huge by our standards, which lead me to believe that I had something of value to share with the world. One thing led to another, and Start Bootstrap was born!

Originally, the site featured only two templates, but I have been pretty diligent with getting at least one or two new templates up each week. I plan to keep on adding templates so the tool will become more and more valuable as it offers more variety.

I’d like to think that this tool is especially great for the “div challenged” developers out there who are great at code, but need a little more of a head start when it comes to design. The intention of Start Bootstrap is to offer some more HTML starter options that can help you get moving in the right direction.

I hope you enjoy these templates, and I encourage you to share them with the world if you like them! Thank you for viewing our website, and keep an eye out for more templates soon!
