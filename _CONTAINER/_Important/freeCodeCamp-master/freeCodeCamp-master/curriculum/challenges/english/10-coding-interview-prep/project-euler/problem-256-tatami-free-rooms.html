<p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>
<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>
<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b. We use the term ‘size’ to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.</p>
<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet. For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>
<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red “X” in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>
<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms. Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.</p>
<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10. All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14. Hence, T(70) = 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320: 20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40. In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.</p>
<p>Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.</p>
