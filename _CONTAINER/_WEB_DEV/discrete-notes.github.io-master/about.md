*Discrete notes* is a blog about discrete maths and theoretical computer science, which are my research interests. 

A similar blog in French is *[Des notes discretes](https://des-notes-discretes.github.io)*. Some posts are translations, but not the majority. Before these blogs I used to write on *[Semidoc](https://semidoc.github.io)*, the blog of the PhD students of IRIF. 

There is no comment section, but you can send me emails, and I'll be happy to answer.
