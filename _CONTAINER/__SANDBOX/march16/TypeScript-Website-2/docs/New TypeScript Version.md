## How to update the TypeScript site for a new version

We'll use 3.9.0 as the example. Note this looks long because there's a lot of explanations, assuming everything compiles then it'll probably take about 15-30m.

### Beta

##### Site

The website uses one version of TypeScript which you can find in the root `package.json` inside the `resolutions` field. It's always a specific version, so change the version to:

```json
  "resolutions": {
    "typescript": "3.9.0-beta",
  },
```

Then run `yarn install`.

That will update all of the site to use 3.9.0 for building. Run `yarn build` to see if any of the website's code broke.

You might see issues with yarn patching TypeScript, if so, try run: `yarn set version latest` first to update to the latest yarn.

##### New Handbook Docs

You might have a new reference doc to add, they live in [`packages/documentation/copy`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website/blob/v2/packages/documentation/copy). You can ignore languages other than `en`. The folder structure is only for your reference and has no bearing on the site navigation. Each markdown document needs a header like:

```md
---
title: Basic Types
layout: docs
permalink: /docs/handbook/basic-types.html
oneline: "Step one in learning TypeScript: The basic types."
---
```

Or the site will fail the build. Once that file is ready, add it to the sidebar via the file [`packages/documentation/scripts/generateDocsNavigationPerLanguage.js`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website/blob/v2/packages/documentation/scripts/generateDocsNavigationPerLanguage.js).

##### TSConfig Reference

Updating the version of TypeScript will force you to update the TSConfig Reference. It will fail incrementally with each missing compiler flag.

For each new flag:

- Add a markdown file for the new compiler flags. The build will crash and give you a command to run which will set that up.

- Update [tsconfigRules.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website/blob/v2/packages/tsconfig-reference/scripts/tsconfigRules.ts#L16) - with things like:

  - Default values
  - Linking compiler versions
  - Add a new section to `releaseToConfigsMap` for your version

#### Playground

The tag should be automatically generated on a [daily basis](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Make-Monaco-Builds/actions/workflows/nightly_check_prod_deploys.yml) - so you shouldn't have to do anything

##### Tests

Run `yarn test`.

Tests can fail between TS builds, for example snapshot tests in packages which have compiler errors or LSP responses in them.
Run `yarn build; yarn update-test-snapshots` to try auto-update all snapshots, otherwise use `yarn workspace [package_name] test -u` for 1 package.

### RC

Unless something drastic has change, you shouldn't need to do anything. You could run through the playground section for the RC and update the dropdown to be the RC.

### Release

#### Release Notes

Grab the markdown from the [blog posts repo](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-blog-posts), create a file like: `packages/documentation/copy/en/release-notes/TypeScript 3.9.md`

Grab the header info from a previous release notes, and add it to your new version:

```md
---
title: TypeScript 3.9
layout: docs
permalink: /docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html
oneline: TypeScript 3.9 Release Notes
---
```

You can add twoslash to the code samples if you want.

When you're happy with that, then edit [`packages/documentation/copy/en/release-notes/Overview.md](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website/blob/v2/packages/documentation/copy/en/release-notes/Overview.md) to include the changes you just added, and simplify descriptions.

##### Index

The homepage keeps track of upcoming dates via this file: [`packages/typescriptlang-org/src/lib/release-plan.json`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website/blob/v2/packages/typescriptlang-org/src/lib/release-plan.json)

```json
{
  "_format": "mm/dd/yyyy - these get put into new Date()",
  "upcoming_version": "3.9",
  "iteration_plan_url": "https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37198",
  "last_release_date": "02/20/2020",
  "upcoming_beta_date": "03/20/2020",
  "upcoming_rc_date": "04/24/2020",
  "upcoming_release_date": "05/12/2020"
}
```

You might not have these dates yet, at the current release (it took about a week last time to get the dates) - leaving
this is fine and the site will accommodate the dates not being ready yet.
