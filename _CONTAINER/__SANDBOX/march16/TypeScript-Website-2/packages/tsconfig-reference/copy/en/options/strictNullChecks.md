display: "Strict Null Checks"
oneline: "When type checking, take into account `null` and `undefined`."

When `strictNullChecks` is `false`, `null` and `undefined` are effectively ignored by the language.
This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime.

When `strictNullChecks` is `true`, `null` and `undefined` have their own distinct types and you'll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected.

For example with this TypeScript code, `users.find` has no guarantee that it will actually find a user, but you can
write code as though it will:

```ts twoslash
// @strictNullChecks: false
// @target: ES2015
declare const loggedInUsername: string;

const users = [
  { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
  { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];

const loggedInUser = users.find((u) => u.name === loggedInUsername);
console.log(loggedInUser.age);
```

Setting `strictNullChecks` to `true` will raise an error that you have not made a guarantee that the `loggedInUser` exists before trying to use it.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339 2532
// @target: ES2020
// @strictNullChecks
declare const loggedInUsername: string;

const users = [
  { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
  { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];

const loggedInUser = users.find((u) => u.name === loggedInUsername);
console.log(loggedInUser.age);
```

The second example failed because the array's `find` function looks a bit like this simplification:

```ts
// When strictNullChecks: true
type Array = {
  find(predicate: (value: any, index: number) => boolean): S | undefined;
};

// When strictNullChecks: false the undefined is removed from the type system,
// allowing you to write code which assumes it always found a result
type Array = {
  find(predicate: (value: any, index: number) => boolean): S;
};
```
