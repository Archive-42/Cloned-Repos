By default (with `esModuleInterop` false or not set) TypeScript treats CommonJS/AMD/UMD modules similar to ES6 modules. In doing this, there are two parts in particular which turned out to be flawed assumptions:

- a namespace import like `import * as moment from "moment"` acts the same as `const moment = require("moment")`

- a default import like `import moment from "moment"` acts the same as `const moment = require("moment").default`

This mis-match causes these two issues:

- the ES6 modules spec states that a namespace import (`import * as x`) can only be an object, by having TypeScript
  treating it the same as `= require("x")` then TypeScript allowed for the import to be treated as a function and be callable. This breaks the spec's recommendations.

- while accurate to the ES6 modules spec, most libraries with CommonJS/AMD/UMD modules didn't conform as strictly as TypeScript's implementation.

Turning on `esModuleInterop` will fix both of these problems in the code transpiled by TypeScript. The first changes the behavior in the compiler,the second is fixed by two new helper functions which provide a shim to ensure compatibility in the emitted JavaScript:

```ts
import * as fs from "fs";
import _ from "lodash";

fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
_.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
```

With `esModuleInterop` disabled:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// @showEmit
// @esModuleInterop: false
// @module: commonjs
import * as fs from "fs";
import _ from "lodash";

fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
_.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
```

With `esModuleInterop` set to `true`:

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// @showEmit
// @esModuleInterop
// @module: commonjs
import * as fs from "fs";
import _ from "lodash";

fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
_.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
```

_Note_: You can make JS emit terser by enabling [`importHelpers`](#importHelpers):

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
// @showEmit
// @esModuleInterop
// @importHelpers
// @module: commonjs
import * as fs from "fs";
import _ from "lodash";

fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
_.chunk(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
```

Enabling `esModuleInterop` will also enable [`allowSyntheticDefaultImports`](#allowSyntheticDefaultImports).
