<p>TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.</p>

<p>Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.</p>

<p>Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.</p>`,

  index_trust: "A Result You Can Trust",
  index_trust_copy_a: `All valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control.`,
  index_trust_copy_b: `TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or <babel>Babel</babel>. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your apps.`,
  index_standards: "Evolving with Standards",
  index_standards_copy: `
  <p>The TypeScript team contributes to the TC39 committees which help guide the evolution of the JavaScript language.</p>

  <p>When new features have reached stage 3, then they are ready for inclusion in TypeScript.</p>
  
  <p>For example the TypeScript team championed proposals like Optional Chaining, Nullish coalescing Operator, Throw Expressions and RegExp Match Indices.</p>`,

  index_gradual: "Gradual Adoption",
  index_gradual_copy: `
<p>Adopting TypeScript is not a binary choice, you can start by annotating existing JavaScript with JSDoc, then switch a few files to be checked by TypeScript and over time prepare your codebase to convert completely.</p>

<p>TypeScript’s type inference means that you don’t have to annotate your code until you want more safety.</p>`,

  index_dts: "Types On Every Desk",
  index_dts_copy: `
<p>Most of the world's JavaScript is un-typed, and inference can only go so far. To address this, the TypeScript team helps maintain <dt>Definitely Typed</dt> - a community project to provide types and inline documentation to existing JavaScript.

<p>This project allows the community to maintain type definitions for JavaScript libraries without putting extra pressure on their maintainers.</p>`,

  index_tools: "Consistently Good Tooling",
  index_tools_copy: `
  <p>By handling a lot of the editor integration inside TypeScript, you can get a consistent experience working in many editors.</p>

  <p>This lets you easily jump between editors like <vs>Visual Studio</vs>, <vsc>Visual Studio Code</vsc>, <nova>Nova</nova>, <atom>Atom</atom>, <subl>Sublime Text</subl>, <emacs>Emacs</emacs>, <vim>Vim</vim>, <webs>WebStorm</webs> and <eclipse>Eclipse</eclipse>.</p>

  <p>TypeScript's editor integration supports JavaScript, so it's quite likely you're already using TypeScript under the hood.
