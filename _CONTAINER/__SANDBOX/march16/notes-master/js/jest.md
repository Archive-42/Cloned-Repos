# Jest Testing Suite

Jest killed any enthusiasm I had for testing in iOS codebases and offered a surprisingly focused set of APIs which really do make testing a delight. To really understand Jest, I started [vscode-jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) which aimed to tightly integrate your tests into your editor.


### Things I Like

- The care and effort into all of the matchers
- Snapshots, and _especially_ inline Snapshots
- How parallel test suite ordering works

### Notes

- How I do [[tests/testing-js]]
- I enjoy inline snapshot tests [[tests/inline-snapshots]]
