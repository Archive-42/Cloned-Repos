# [Project Euler](https://ProjectEuler.net)
[This Python 3 notebook](Project%20Euler%20%28Python%203%29.ipynb) contains *some* solutions for the [Project Euler](https://ProjectEuler.net) challenge.

### /!\ **Warning:** do not spoil yourself the pleasure of solving these problems by yourself!

[I (Lilian Besson)](http://perso.crans.org/besson/) started in February 2015, and worked occasionally on Project Euler problems in March and April 2015.
I should try to work on it again, hence this notebook...
