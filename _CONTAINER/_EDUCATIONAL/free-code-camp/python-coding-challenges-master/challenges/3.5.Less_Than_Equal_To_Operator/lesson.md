## Python Less Than or Equal To Operator  

The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers.  
If the number to the left is less than or equal the number to the right, it returns True.  
If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns False.

>>> a = 2
>>> b = 2
>>> c = 3
>>> a <= b
True
>>> c <= a
False
>>> b <= c
True
```

**_Instructions:_**   
**In the console, there is a function named less_or_equal() that has an if-elif-else statement.**  
**In the lines with the 'if' and 'elif' clauses, fill in the less-than-equal-to operator and the appropriate values to make the function run properly.**
