## Python Minimum Value

The function min() returns the smallest item in an iterable (like a list or string), or the smallest of two or more arguments.  
This lesson is in the math section, so we will focus on using min() to find the smallest number in a list.  
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min
```
>>> min(2, 5, 1, 4, 3)
1
>>> min(2, 5.0, 1.0, 4, 3)
1.0
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**The starter code has a list of numbers named, well, numbers.**  
**The variable lowest is initialized to numbers.**  
**Make the value of lowest equal the smallest number in numbers.**
