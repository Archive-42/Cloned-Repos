## Python Integer Division

Python 3 distinguishes between integer (floor) division and float (true) division.  
Python uses a double forward slash (//) operator for integer division.  
When using integer division, Python will round the quotient down to the nearest whole number.

>>> 1 // 1
1
>>> 3 // 2
1
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**When you run the existing code, the variable named quotient will have a value of 1.**   
**Change the the second number (the denominator) so that quotient has a value of 2.**
