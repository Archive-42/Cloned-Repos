== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tB3rKkwAJY

Media cloud is a revolutionary plug-in for WordPress that will supercharge the performance of your website and radically transform the way that you work with media in WordPress.

Media Cloud works by moving your images, media and other files from your WordPress server to online cloud storage such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, DigitalOcean Spaces, DreamHost Object Storage and many others.  You can then serve that media through a CDN like Amazon Cloud front, Cloudflare, Fastly and others.

Beyond cloud storage, Media Cloud also has deep integration with Imgix, the leading real-time image manipulation and optimization CDN.  Media Cloud is the first plugin for WordPress to bring the full benefit of what Imgix offers - simplifying your development efforts, reducing your site’s page load times and opening up creative options that simply haven’t existed until now.

Media Cloud also provides advanced image editing tools that provide improved cropping options, effects, filters, watermarking and more.

**NOTE**: This plugin requires PHP 7.1 or higher

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this compare to WP Offload Media? =

WP Offload Media provides a very small subset of everything Media Cloud provides.

This plugin is an essential part of our own development stack when creating WordPress solutions for our clients and as client needs grow around media, and dealing with media in WordPress, Media Cloud gains new features and improvements.

= Why should I use Imgix? =

One of the headaches of managing a WordPress site is dealing with server disk space.  If you just use the S3 functionality of this plugin, you are already one step ahead.  Using S3, all of your media is centrally located in one place that you can then distribute through a high performing content delivery network to improve page load speeds for your site.  You also don't have to worry about disk space on your servers anymore.

Imgix is a content delivery network with a twist.  In addition to distributing your media, it also allows you to edit them, in real-time. and deliver the edited version through their CDN without altering the original.  Want to add a new image size to your theme?  You can do this with Imgix without having to use a plugin to recut all of your existing media to this new size.  Imgix optimizes format delivery and a bunch of other things.  It's seriously the greatest thing to happen to WordPress and web development in the history of ever.

7. Redesign settings.
8. Easily pin frequently accessed settings.


== Changelog ==

= 4.1.14 =

* Added missing instructions that caused errors on multisite installs.
* Added `privacy` ACL to cloud storage uploads.  Since the first days of Media Cloud, we've been using the `authenticated-read`
  ACL for private cloud storage uploads.  There was a historical reason for that and functionally there is no difference
  between `authenticated-read` and `private` ACLs for nearly all cloud storage providers.  If you are using Scaleway and have
  private uploads enabled, make sure you change the privacy settings from Authenticated Read to Private.  For other
  cloud storage providers you do not need to do this, but we suggest you do.  You will also need to change the privacy on
  any existing private uploads by going to the Media Library, switching to list view, filtering on `Authenticated Read`
  and then doing a bulk action `Change Privacy to Private`.
* Added the ability to specify a custom region.  Mostly useful for S3 compatible cloud storage providers, but also useful
  when Amazon released a new region and their is a lag time for us updating our list.
* Fixed changing ACL on the attachment edit screen to update the ACL for any generated image sizes.
* Fix for direct uploading non-image files when using the "Add New" page in WordPress admin.
* Added a new debugging mode that will generate a CSV log file of URL replacements on a given page.  Enable it by going to
  **Media Cloud -> Debug Settings** and toggle on **Debug Content Filtering**.  Visit a page that you are having issues
  with and a log file will be generated in your `WP-CONTENT/mcloud-reports` directory.  DO NOT LEAVE THIS RUNNING.  Turn
  it on, load your page, turn it off.  Note that this CSV file only logs URL replacements that happen in the content of
  a post, it will not log URL replacements that happen elsewhere in your page that are the result of calling functions
  like `wp_get_image_src()` in your templates.
* Fixed URL replacements for video and audio shortcodes (videos inserted with classic editor or via the [video] shortcode).
* Last day to use BLACKFRIDAY2020 for 33% off annual licenses, ends December 3rd!

= 4.1.9 =

* Fix for when using the ShortPixel plugin and have Media Cloud configured **NOT** to upload PDFs to cloud storage.
* Fix for unlinking non-image files.
* Unlink task now generates a report which you can find in your `WP_CONTENT/mcloud-reports` directory.

= 4.1.8 =

* And we're back.  Thanks to everyone for the well wishes, truly appreciated!
* Updated Freemius SDK to latest
* Added `mcloud-cloud/storage/should-handle-image-upload` filter to override image uploading logic when performing uploads

* Added option to turn off brute force image URL replacement for image tags missing the `wp-image-{NUMBER}` css class.
  If you are seeing a lot of database calls on a page with a lot of images, try adding this snippet to your theme's functions.php
  to insure that Media Cloud has enough "metadata" to do it's job:  https://gist.github.com/jawngee/36c104f8a8b8ea7e7f6b0f0b837affa5
* Launched new support and helpdesk site, https://support.mediacloud.press/

* Use BLACKFRIDAY2020 for 33% off annual licenses, good until December 2nd.

= 4.1.6 =

* When Debugging is enabled, a log file will be generated next to the CSV report.  This log file includes all the logging
  that would normally be in the Debug Log, but limited to the time period the task was running.  If you are running into
  issues with a task, make sure to turn on Debugging, re-run the task and then attach both the CSV and the log file
  to a support ticket https://support.mediacloud.press/submit-issue/
* The `report` command line command has been renamed to `verify`
* You can run the Verify Library task from the WordPress admin by going to Media Cloud -> Task Manager.  In the
  **Available Tasks** click on **Verify Library**.  When it is done running, a report will be in your
  `WP_CONTENT/mcloud-reports` directory
* Added a Sync Local task that copies down media from cloud storage to your local server.  You can run it from the
  WordPress admin by going to Media Cloud -> Task Manager.  In the **Available Tasks** click on **Sync Local**.
* You can also run the Sync Local task from the command line via `wp mediacloud syncLocal report-filename.csv`
* Fixed a bug with direct uploads where the cloud storage provider wasn't being saved in the cloud metadata.  If you
  run the Verify Library task, Media Cloud will fix the issue with any existing direct uploads in your library.
* Added paging to the `syncLocal` and `verify` command line commands, ex: `wp mediacloud verify verify.csv --limit=100 --page=1`
* Fixed Sync Local, Verify Library and Regenerate Thumbnails to work with Imgix enabled.

= 4.1.4 =

* Fix for Regenerate Thumbnails command, it will first attempt to download the original image, if that can't be found then
  it will use the "scaled" image that WordPress 5.5 generates.

  on their cloud storage status.
* The Migrate To Cloud, Import From Cloud, Clean Uploads and Regenerate Thumbnails tasks now generate CSV reports when
  they run so you can see more details about what they did.  The reports are located in your
  `WP_CONTENT/mcloud-reports` directory.
* You can toggle task reporting on or off in the Settings -> Batch Processing settings or through the
  `MCLOUD_TASKS_GENERATE_REPORTS` environment variable.  The default value is ON.
* The Migrate To Cloud task has a new toggle *Generate Verification Report* which causes the task to verify that the
  media migrated successfully.   This will generate a report in the aforementioned reports directory.
* The `migrateToCloud` wp-cli command now accepts a `--verify` flag to force verification.

* When transitioning from 2.x to 3.x, Media Cloud used to delete the old 2.x settings after copying them to the renamed 3.x settings.  This made it impossible to go back to 2.x without having to re-enter all of your settings.  The migration process no longer deletes your old 2.x settings.

= 3.1.0 =

* Backblaze support re-added.  Note that the *asset push* and *direct upload* features do not work with Backblaze.
* Added option to Migrate to Storage to skip uploading thumbnails. This option requires Imgix or Dynamic Images and will only appear if either is enabled.
* Added option to Migrate to Storage to control how upload paths are handled. This option requires that you have a custom prefix defined in Cloud Storage settings and will only appear if you do.
* Fixes for Migrate to Storage when run in ajax (non-background) mode.
* Updated migrate command line command to include switches for skipping thumbnails and handling upload paths.
* For more information about this release: [3.1.0 Release Notes](https://talk.mediacloud.press/topic/40/3-1-0-release-notes)

= 3.0.9 =

* Updated S3 regions
* Fix for duplicate thumbnail during import process (thanks @jeryj)
* You can now compress assets with gzip before pushing them to cloud storage (pro version)
* Bug fixes for Google Cloud Storage

= 3.0.7 =

* **IMPORTANT**  If you are using Backblaze, please do not update until the Backblaze addon has been approved by WordPress.org
* Over 100 bug fixes and general improvements
* Improved integration with Smart Slider 3, Master Slide, NextGEN Gallery
* Backblaze support removed from main plugin and provided as a free add-on (waiting for WordPress.org review)
* Crop tool now allows aspect ratio to be toggled on or off when cropping
* Redesigned settings
* Improved customizer support
* Added `unlink` WP-CLI command for unlinking the media library from cloud storage
* Batch settings for controlling how background batch processes run
* Extensive documentation
* Improved image optimizer integration
* Allow default credential provider to be used with S3

= 2.1.23 =
* Fix for non-image uploads not uploading
* Fix for the storage importer skipping audio or video items when importing

= 2.1.22 =
* Fix for thumbnails not being uploaded when using a custom `upload_dir` filter
* Fix for situations where your storage credentials don't work but you are unable to get Media Cloud "unstuck" from thinking the settings are bad
* Fix for the troubleshooter tool not being available if storage settings are turned off

= 2.1.21 =
* Debug logger will now log all php errors and warnings
* If you add a filter for WordPress's `upload_dir`, Media Cloud would ignore it.  It still does, but you can make it honor it by setting the Upload File Prefix setting to an empty value or return FALSE from the new `ilab_storage_should_use_custom_prefix` filter.

= 2.1.20 =
* Fixed EWWW Image Optimizer compatibility
* Fixed compatibility with Offload S3 when transition to Media Cloud from that plugin
* Fixed a bug for when you have the `wp-cli/wp-cli` package installed via composer when using Bedrock

= 2.1.19 =
* Completely revamped the importer, thumbnail regeneration and batch rekognition processor.
* Added a setting in Storage Settings that allows you to specify the connection timeout for background processing for the importer and other batch tools.  This could be helpful in some hosting situations.  If you've been getting the `cURL 28` error, try increasing this setting.
* Added a setting in Storage Settings to do the batch importing in the browser, instead of in the background on the server.  This is more reliable as the browser is directing the batch, **HOWEVER**, you cannot close the browser window while a batch is running.  If you cannot get background batch processing working, turn this on.
* Revamped the importer interface.  It now shows the thumbnail of the image that it currently being processed.


= 2.1.18 =
* PHP 5.6 related fixes.
* Added PHP version compatibilty check to the Troubleshooter tool
* The Troubleshooter tool is always enabled (as long as Storage is enabled)

= 2.1.17 =
* Added toggle to serve images from your storage provider using signed URLs (S3 only right now)
* Add option to serve GIFs from S3 (or whatever storage provider) instead of Imgix, if you have Imgix enabled.  Animated GIFs are a premium Imgix feature, so this option works around that a little.

= 2.1.16 =
* Fix for image_intermediate_size for imgix URLs (thanks Tobias Alex-Petersen)
* Fix for image scaling (thanks Tobias Alex-Petersen)
* Support for WordPress's crop positions (thanks Zac M-W)
* Support for defining default imgix parameters for sizes. Instead of using `add_image_size($name, $width, $height, $crop)`, use `addImigixImageSize($name, $width, $height, $crop, $imgixParams)`.
* System report now includes active plugins and active must use plugins
* Before running the importer, or bulk rebuilding thumbnails, first test that we can access the server without any issues.  If there is an issue it is displayed as an error to the end user.
* Added Troubleshooter page that will help you troubleshoot any basic setup problems you might be having.  To turn on, enabled Media Cloud Debugging and then navigate to "Troubleshooter" in the admin navigation.


= 2.1.15 =
* Added compatibility for ShortPixel Image Optimizer
* Added compatibility for EWW Image Optimizer
* Added compatibility for Smush Image Optimizer (Note: Smush is not compatible with Media Cloud when using Imgix).
* Added compatibility for Imagify Image Optimizer (The best we tested, btw)
* Ability to keep WordPress generated thumbnails when using Imgix

= 2.1.14 =
* Media Cloud debugging now logs to database, no need to configure php.ini.
* Improved stablity of the importer.  Even if one item fails to import, the rest should continue processing.

= 2.1.13 =
* Skipped for superstitious reasons

= 2.1.12 =
* Version bump to match github

= 2.1.11 =
* Fixed a cropping related bug

= 2.1.10 =
* Using WordPress's image editor now works with Media Cloud.  Crops, rotations, etc. will be re-uploaded to S3.
* Added more Rekognition regions
* When theme or plugin zip files are uploaded, skip handling them with Media Cloud

= 2.1.8 =
* Compatibility fixes for Foo Gallery, Master Slider, Photo Gallery, and Smart Slider 3
* Added warning and error notices for plugins that are incompatible with Media Cloud: NextGEN Gallery, Smush.it, ShortPixel Image Optimizer, MetaSlider, Imagify, and EWWW Image Optimizer.
* Updated FAQ

= 2.1.7 =
* Fix for bbPress front-end user uploads.  Should fix issues with other front-end user uploads too.
* Added warning for BuddyPress.  Imgix features of the plugin and BuddyPress are not compatible.  BuddyPress does some strange upload stuff and is a convoluted mess.  I tried, but I gave up.

= 2.1.6 =
* Fix for importer.  Imported file's directory structure is retained when importing into S3.
* Fix for compatibility with WooCommerce and a lot of other plugins


= 2.1.5 =

* Direct uploads via Wasabi (requires Imgix)
* Fix for direct uploads failing
* Fix for CSS issues on settings pages

= 2.0.9 =
* Added support for detecting faces using Imgix's API.  You can enable this setting in the Imgix settings.  With the detected faces, you can use those in the `Focus Crop` settings of the image editor.  **Note** that Rekognition does a vastly superior job in detecting faces (sorry Imgix) and I would urge you to use that instead.  But if you aren't using Amazon S3 for storage, you'll have to use the Imgix face detection if you want to use the Focus Crop feature.
* Added support for Imgix's Entropy and Edges cropping modes (https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/size/crop).  You can access these in the image editor.

= 2.0.8 =
* Added support for Imgix's Focal Point Cropping (read about it here: https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/size/crop).  Right now it only supports focal cropping to a point, however it can use faces that have been detected with the Amazon Rekognition feature of the plugin.  Yes, I know, Imgix has this feature using their face detection and I will add it in the future!
* To use the new Focal Point Cropping, click on `Edit Image` in attachment details to open up the Imgix Image Editor.  Click on the "Focus Crop" tab and go to town.

= 2.0.7 =
* Added WP-CLI support
* Added WP-CLI command `wp mediacloud import` to import the media library to cloud storage from the command line.
* Added WP-CLI command `wp mediacloud regenerate` to rebuild thumbnails for cloud storage from the command line.
* Added WP-CLI command `wp rekognition process` to run the media library through Amazon Rekognition from the command line.

= 2.0.6 =
* Fix for PHP 5.6.  Was using a couple of PHP 7.x features.
* Slimmed down the size of the plugin.

= 2.0.5 =
* Fix for uploading non-image files.  This bug was introduced in 2.0.3.  If you've uploaded non-image files since then, you'll need to re-upload them.  Sorry!
* Hovering over the cloud icon when in the media library grid will display storage info about that file

= 2.0.4 =
* Greatly enhanced the Storage Info panel on the attachment details edit page.  This now shows you all of the different sizes that have been generated, as well as any that might be missing.
* Added the ability to rebuild thumbnails.  If you are using Imgix, this is unnecessary.  If you aren't using Imgix, you should be using Imgix.  You're never going to do better than Imgix.  Relying on WordPress to resize your images and then serve those images from a CDN tied to your cloud storage is a better choice than just serving everything from WordPress, but you are still inserting management tasks into your workflow that Imgix alleviates entirely.  Seriously, check it out.  If you still want to persist with this madness, then this new thumbnail regeneration feature is built just for you.  Enjoy.
* Added "Regenerate Thumbnails" bulk action to WordPress's media library list view.  Use Imgix and you'll never have to worry about this stuff ever again.

= 2.0.3 =
* Fix for bug when deleting from remote storage
* Fix for CDN URL not being applied
