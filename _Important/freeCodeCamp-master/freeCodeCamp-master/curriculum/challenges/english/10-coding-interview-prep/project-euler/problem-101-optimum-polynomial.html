<p>If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>
<p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, …</p>
<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that “simple is best” we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>
<p>We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n ≤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).</p>
<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u1.</p>
<p>Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:</p>
<p>OP(1, n) = 1 1, 1, 1, 1, … OP(2, n) = 7n−6 1, 8, 15, … OP(3, n) = 6n2−11n+6 1, 8, 27, 58, … OP(4, n) = n3 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, …</p>
<p>Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4. By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74. Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function: un = 1 − n + n2 − n3 + n4 − n5 + n6 − n7 + n8 − n9 + n10 Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>
