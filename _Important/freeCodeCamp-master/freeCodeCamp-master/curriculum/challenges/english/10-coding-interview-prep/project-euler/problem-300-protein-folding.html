<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH.</p>
<p>For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2n distinct proteins consisting of n elements.</p>
<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous. As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside. Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in two dimensions.</p>
<p>The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).</p>
<p>The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally. On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p>
<p>Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 28=3.3203125.</p>
<p>What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15? Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.</p>
