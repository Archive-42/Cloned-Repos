<p>“The Chase” is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.</p>
<p>The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it. If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn. The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>
<p>In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts? Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.</p>
