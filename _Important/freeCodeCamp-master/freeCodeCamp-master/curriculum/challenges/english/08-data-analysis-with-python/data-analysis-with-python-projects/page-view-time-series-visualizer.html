<p>For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.</p>
<p>You can access <a href="https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-page-view-time-series-visualizer">the full project description and starter code on Repl.it</a>.</p>
<p>After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in ‘README.md’, submit your project link below.</p>
<p>We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the data analysis with Python curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.</p>
