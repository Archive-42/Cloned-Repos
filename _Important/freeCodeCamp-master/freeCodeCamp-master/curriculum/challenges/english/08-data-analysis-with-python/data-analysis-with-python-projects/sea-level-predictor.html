<p>In this project, you will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.</p>
<p>You can access <a href="https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-sea-level-predictor">the full project description and starter code on Repl.it</a>.</p>
<p>After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in ‘README.md’, submit your project link below.</p>
<p>We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the data analysis with Python curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.</p>
