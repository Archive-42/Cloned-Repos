# Analogies

If you still aren't convinced by the reasons *why* you should be testing *all the things* while you build software, read through the following analogies:

## Musicians Learn *Fundamental Skills* on their Instrument

Most of us have at least *attempted* to learn a musical instrument.
Learning Test Driven Development (TDD) is like learning/practicing "*scales*"
when learning to play a musical instrument.
It can seem like a "*waste of time*" to a ~~young~~ *novice musician* who *only*
wants to learn *enough* to play their favourite song, *but* by learning/practicing sequences of notes in quick succession, we are able to unlock a whole
other level of musical excellence.

*Persistence* pays *handsomly*. (*Automated*) *Testing* is one of the *fundamental skills* of *software development*.
*Embrace* it if you want to unlock the next level in your ***creativity***.

## Buildings Need a *Good Foundation*

Consider what it takes to build even a modest *physical* building.
Anything over a single level requires much consideration and planning.
If you are *lucky* enough to live in a country with *well established building
regulations* the following sight will be unfamiliar to you:

When a building is constructed by inexperienced people,
they often "*forget*" to dig/lay a foundation.
This failure will only be visible months/years later (*usually after
  the cowboy builders have made off with the cash*).
(Automated) tests are the foundation of great software.
Competent civil engineers would not *dream* of constructing a building without
a foundation, as software engineers we should have the same approach.

The ***confidence*** that comes when building upon a solid foundation only arises if we ***put in the time*** to *first* ***dig a foundation***.

## Car Designers Have a *Testing Mindset*

*Thinking about* ***how*** you will ***test your solution*** to a problem, changes the way you *perceive* the problem. It might seem initially counter-intuitive to
think about the test *before* you have solved the problem, but we *urge* you to consider the perspective of a car designer:

We don't like thinking about car accidents (*they are brutal and often fatal!*)
but a *great* car designer will *always* consider the "*worst case scenario*"
for their vehicle and *design* with that eventuality in mind.

Sure, the fast convertible *looks nice*, but if you had to ***pick a car for your loved ones***, would it be sports car
or the [*Volvo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Zdvwacxik)
with the dedicated team of life-saving expert engineers.

Put your [*lab coat*](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/6) on
and *embrace* the ***discipline*** of proactively thinking about how to test your creations!s
