## List of Continuous Delivery Platforms



### OpenSource (DIY)

+ Strider: https://github.com/strider-CD/strider
(Open Source - Node.js + MongoDB)
+ Jenkins: https://jenkins-ci.org/content/about-jenkins-ci
(Super powerful and "full featured" but has a steep learning curve
and runs on Java so is *blocking* and memory-hungry)
