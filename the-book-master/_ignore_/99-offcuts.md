# Intro Section

*Some* people have a coding "*day job*" ~~they attend between 9-to-5,
to collect a paycheck~~ to fund their other (*more important?*) activities;
e.g. raising a family, traveling or playing/watching sport/music/video games.


If you have trouble switching off from your work leaving your work at work (*because things keep*
  "***breaking***") or switching off, or just want some
"***work-life-balance***" (*automated*) ***testing*** is your ***best friend***!

Its so easy for a promising product to not fulfill its purpose.

# Removed from readme

If you are *not* doing TDD in your projects I *might* not be
the one to change your mind by evangelizing about it ... I know
(*and have worked with*) plenty of
people *calling* themesleves "developers" who stubbornly cling to the notion
that *testing is for "QA"* or "*that's why we have testers*" or "*we will write tests later, we just need to release this ASAP!*" etc...
