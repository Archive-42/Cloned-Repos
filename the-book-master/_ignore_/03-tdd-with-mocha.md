![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We all know *Cowboy Coders*.

The "*I just get things done*" developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
maintains "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ...

#### Installation

```sh
sudo npm install -g mocha
```

You should see some output *confirming* it *installed*:

![Mocha Installed](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-installed.png "Mocha Installed Successfully")

More info: http://mochajs.org/#installation

### First Tests

#### Create Test Directory

In your project create a new **/test** directory to hold your tests:

```sh
mkdir test
```

#### Create test.js File

Now create a new file ./test/**test.js** in your text editor

and write/paste the following code:

```js
var assert = require("assert"); // node.js core module

describe('Array', function(){
  describe('#indexOf()', function(){
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function(){
      assert.equal(-1, [1,2,3].indexOf(4)); // 4 is not present in this array so indexOf returns -1
    })
  })
});
```

#### Run Test

By typing the command **mocha** in your terminal the mocha comand line program
will look for a **/test** directory and run any **.js** files it contains:

```sh
mocha
```

### A More Useful TDD Example (Cash Register Mini Project)

While I'm the first to agree that *cash-less* payments are the future,
paying with cash is something *everyone* can relate to and is therefore
a good example to use. (*think of better TDD example*? *tell me*!)


#### Basic Requirements

> Given a **Total Payable** and **Cash From Customer**
> Return: **Change To Customer** (notes and coins).

Essentially we are building a *simple* **calculator** that *only does* **subtraction**
(Total - Cash = Change), but also splits the **result** into the various **notes & coins**.

In the UK we have the following Notes & Coins:

![GBP Notes](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/gbp-notes.jpg "GBP Notes")
![GBP Coins](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/gbp-coins.jpg "GBP Coins")

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling
(technically there are also £100 and even £100,000,000 notes,
but these aren't common so we can leave them out. ;-)

If we use the penny as the unit (i.e. 100 pennies in a pound)
the notes and coins can be represented as:

- 5000 (£50)
- 2000 (£20)
- 1000 (£10)
-  500 (£5)
-  200 (£2)
-  100 (£1)
-   50 (50p)
-   20 (20p)
-   10 (10p)
-    5 (5p)
-    2 (2p)
-    1 (1p)

this can be represented as an Array:

```javascript
var coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
```

**Note**: the same can be done for any other cash system ($ ¥ €)
simply use the cent, sen or rin as the unit and scale up notes.

#### The First Test

If you are *totally* new to TDD I recommend reading this
[intro article](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) by Scott Ambler
(especially the diagrams) otherwise this (test-fail-code-pass) process
may seem *strange* ...

In **T**est **F**irst **D**evelopment (TFD) we write a test *first* and *then*
write the code that makes the test pass.

so, back in our ./test/**test.js** file add the following line:

```javascript
var C = require('../cash.js');  // our module
```

#### Watch it Fail

Back in your terminal window, re-run the **mocha** command and watch it *fail*:

```sh
mocha
```

![Mocha TFD Fail](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-tfd-cannot-find-module-first-fail.png "Mocha TFD Fail")

This error ("**Cannot find module '../cash.js'**") is pretty self explanatory.
We haven't created the file yet so test.js is requesting a non-existent file!

> **Q**: Why *deliberately* write a test we *know* is going to *fail*...? <br />
> **A**: To get used to the idea of *only* writing the code required to *pass*
>    the *current* (*failing*) *test*.


#### Create the Module File

Create a new file for our cash register **cash.js**:

```sh
touch cash.js
```

**Note**: We are *not* going to add any code to it just yet.

Re-run the **mocha** command in terminal, it will pass (*zero* tests)

![Mocha Pass 0 Tests](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-0-passing.png "Mocha Pass 0 Tests")

Lets add a test to ./test/**test.js** and watch it fail again:

```javascript
var assert = require("assert"); // core module
var C = require('../cash.js');  // our module

describe('Cash Register', function(){
  describe('Module C', function(){
    it('should have a getChange Method', function(){
      assert.equal(typeof C, 'object');
      assert.equal(typeof C.getChange, 'function');
    })
  })
});  
```
Re-run `mocha`:

![Mocha 1 Test Failing](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-first-test-failing.png "Mocha 1 Test Failing")

#### Write *Just* Enough Code to Make the Test Pass

Add the following to **cash.js**:

```javascript
var C = {};                    // C Object simplifies exporting the module
C.getChange = function () {    // enough to satisfy the test
    'use strict';
    return true;               // also passes JSLint
};
module.exports = C;            // export the module with a single method
```

Re-run `mocha` (now it passes):

![Mocha 1 Test Passes](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-1-test-pass.png "Mocha 1 Test Passes")


#### Write A Real Test

Going back to the requirements, we need our getChange method to accept
two arguments/parameters (**totalPayable** and **cashPaid**) and return an
array containing the coins equal to the difference:

e.g:
```
totalPayable = 210         // £2.10
cashPaid     = 300         // £3.00
dfference    =  90         // 90p
change       = [50,20,20]  // 50p, 20p, 20p
```

Add the following test to ./test/**test.js**:

```javascript
it('getChange(210,300) should equal [50,20,20]', function(){
    assert.deepEqual(C.getChange(210,300), [50,20,20]);
})
```

**Note**: use assert.**deepEqual** for arrays
see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13225274/

![Mocha Assertion Error](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-assertionError.png "Mocha Assertion Error")

#### Write the Method to Pass the Test

What if I cheat?

```javascript
C.getChange = function (totalPayable, cashPaid) {
    'use strict';
    return [50, 20, 20];    // just enough to pass :-)
};
```

This will pass:

![Mocha Passing](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-2-passing.png "Mocha 2 Passing")

This only works *once*. When the Spec (Test) Writer writes the next test, the method will need
to be re-written to satisfy it.

Lets try it.  Work out what you expect:
```
totalPayable = 486           // £4.86
cashPaid     = 1000          // £10.00
dfference    = 514           // £5.14
change       = [500,10,2,2]  // £5, 10p, 2p, 2p
```

Add the following test to ./test/**test.js** and re-run `mocha`:

```javascript
it('getChange(486,1000) should equal [500, 10, 2, 2]', function(){
    assert.deepEqual(C.getChange(486,1000), [500, 10, 2, 2]);
})
```

As expected, our lazy method fails:

![Mocha 3 Test Fails](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-2-passing-1-fail.png "Mocha 3rd Test Fails")

#### Keep Cheating or Solve the Problem?

We could keep cheating by writing a series of if statements:

```javascript
C.getChange = function (totalPayable, cashPaid) {
    'use strict';
    if(totalPayable == 486 && cashPaid == 1000)
        return [500, 10, 2, 2];
    else if(totalPayable == 210 && cashPaid == 300)
        return [50, 20, 20];
};
```
The *Arthur Andersen Approach* gets results:

![Mocha 3 Passing](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-3-passing.png "Mocha 3 Passing")

But its arguably *more work* than simply *solving* the problem.
Lets do that instead.
(**Note**: this is the *readable* version of the solution! feel free to suggest a more compact algorithm)

```javascript
var C = {};     // C Object simplifies exporting the module
C.coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
C.getChange = function (totalPayable, cashPaid) {
    'use strict';
    var change = [];
    var length = C.coins.length;
    var remaining = cashPaid - totalPayable;          // we reduce this below

    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) { // loop through array of notes & coins:
        var coin = C.coins[i];

        if(remaining/coin >= 1) { // check coin fits into the remaining amount
            var times = Math.floor(remaining/coin);        // no partial coins

            for(var j = 0; j < times; j++) {     // add coin to change x times
                change.push(coin);
                remaining = remaining - coin;  // subtract coin from remaining
            }
        }
    }
    return change;
};
```

Add one more test to ensure we are *fully* exercising our method:

```
totalPayable = 1487                                 // £14.87  (fourteen pounds and eighty-seven pence)
cashPaid     = 10000                                // £100.00 (one hundred pounds)
dfference    = 8513                                 // £85.13
change       = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]   // £50, £20, £10, £5, 10p, 2p, 1p
```

```javascript
it('getChange(1487,10000) should equal [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]', function(){
    assert.deepEqual(C.getChange(1487,10000), [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]);
});
```

### Background

#### What is Mocha?

Mocha is a **JavaScript test framework** running on **node.js**
*and* the **browser**.

![Mocha Logo](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/mocha-logo.png "Mocha Logo")

Made by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk) creator of
[Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) (*by far* the *most popular*
node.js web framework), Mocha is TJ's answer to the problem of testing JavaScript.

- Site: http://mochajs.org
- Code: https://github.com/mochajs/mocha

#### Why Mocha?

At last count there were 83 testing frameworks *listed* on the node.js
modules page: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-testing
this is *both* a problem (*too much choice* can be
*overwhelming*) and good thing (diversity means new ideas and innovative
solutions can flourish).

There's no hard+fast rule for "*which testing framework is the best one*?"

Over the past 3 years I've tried:
[Assert (Core Module)](http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html),
[Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js),
[Expresso](https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso)
[Jasmine](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node),
[Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha),
[Nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit),
[Should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js), and
[Vows](https://github.com/cloudhead/vows)

My **criteria** for chosing a testing framework:

- **Simplicity** (one of TJ's *stated aims*)
- **Elegance** (*especially when written in CoffeeScript*)
- **Speed** (Mocha is *Fast*. 300+ tests run in under a second)
- **Documentation** (plenty of real-world examples: http://mochajs.org)
- **Maturity** (*Battle-tested* by *thousands* of developers!)

Advanced:

- Easy to Trouble-shoot (Plenty of *Answered* Questions on
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mocha?sort=frequent&pageSize=15))
- Automatic Test Running when File Changes (using
[Watchr](https://github.com/bevry/watchr)/[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/))
- Detailed reports of test execution (extensible reports!)

#### Rant

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

![Building Collapse](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/building-collapse-940x627.jpg "Building Collapse")

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

Is Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software
development woes? *Short answer*: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But *without tests* reliability is *impossible*.

If you are *not* doing TDD in your projects I'm probably not going to be
the one to change your mind by evangelizing about it. I know plenty of
people calling themesleves "developers" who stubbornly cling to the idea
that testing is for "QA" or "That's why we have testers" and wish them
nothing but the best of luck! I just cant't work with you or use your
"product", no hard feelings. :-)
