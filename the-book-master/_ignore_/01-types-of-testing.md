## *Manual* Testing

*Many* people writing software *today* *still* "*test*" their work by *manually*
clicking-through their app *each time* they make a *change*.

This works while an app is *small* and has few components, but ***does not
scale*** as functionality grows.

Sadly, there are still *plenty* of people working as software developers
who cling to the "**its not *my* job**" attitude towards writing tests.
We want to dispel the *myth* that
We want to change that by showing everyone how *productive

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q**: Is there still a place for *manual* testing?  
**Yes** (Absolutely)! Manual testing should done by:
+ Your **Quality Assurance** (**QA**) people, who sign off on a feature
before it gets published.
+ The **Product Owner(s)** (person/people responsible for
  prioritising which feature should be built first)
+ **Existing** *or* ***potential*** **users** of your product/service
can (should) be invited to test any new **User Interface** (UI),
**User Experience** (UX) or **Accessibility**; *nothing is more insightful
than watching people use your app/site*.
+ **Compliance Team** check over a product before it can be released (if you operate in a *regulated industry*)
+ **Penetration Testing** in many cases is still performed *manually* (albeit using
  scripts and semi-automated tools) the expert tester still needs to *observe* the
  output to confirm the system under test is not vulnerable to *know atacks*.
