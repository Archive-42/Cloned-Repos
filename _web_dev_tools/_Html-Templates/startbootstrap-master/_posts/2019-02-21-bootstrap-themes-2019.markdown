## Themes Redesigned for 2019

<hr class="mb-4">

#### [SB Admin 2 - Free Bootstrap Admin Theme](/themes/sb-admin-2 "SB Admin 2 - A Free Bootstrap Admin Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">SB Admin 2 - a free Bootstrap admin theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Our most popular theme got a long anticipated design update in 2019. SB Admin 2 is now compatible with Bootstrap 4, and features a fresh new design, brand new layouts, and new UX features. Created with a modern, flat material design style in mind, SB Admin 2 is now more powerful and adaptable than ever, and is still one of the most popular free Bootstrap admin themes currently on the web.

#### [Creative - Free Multipurpose Bootstrap Theme](/themes/creative "Creative - A Free Multipurpose Bootstrap Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Creative - a free multipurpose Bootstrap theme</figcaption>
</figure>

With over half a million downloads to its name, Creative is Start Bootstrap’s most popular landing page theme. This theme has already been updated for 2019 with a bit of a design refresh, and some code cleanup. The original flat design style has been slightly polished to look a bit more modern, but retains its original look and feel.

#### [Grayscale - Free Bootstrap Theme](/themes/grayscale "Grayscale - A Free Bootstrap Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Grayscale - a free Bootstrap theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Grayscale was one of our first one page Bootstrap themes, and was is desperate need of a design refresh. The new Grayscale design uses dramatic gradients, a high contrast black and white style, and a monotone color palette to create a fresh new look.

#### [Freelancer - Free Bootstrap Portfolio Theme](/themes/freelancer "Freelancer - A Free Bootstrap Portfolio Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Freelancer - a free Bootstrap portfolio theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Freelancer’s fun feel, flat design, and bright colors have been a mainstay on Start Bootstrap since the themes release in 2014. Since then, Freelancer’s flat, illustration focused design has held up! We have updated the theme with the original feel and functionality from a design and UX standpoint in mind, but the code quality has been greatly improved!

## Themes with Major Updates Pending in 2019

<hr class="mb-4">

#### [Coming Soon - Free Bootstrap Coming Soon Page Theme](/themes/coming-soon "Coming Soon - A Free Bootstrap Coming Soon Page Theme by Start Bootstrap")

<figure>

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Coming Soon - a free Bootstrap coming soon page theme</figcaption>
</figure>

The Coming Soon theme was created as a more experimental theme. The color palette is very muted and professional. The major thing that this theme has going for it is the video background. What to expect in the Coming Soon theme update is a redesign which gives the theme a more modern look and feel with more flexible customization options.

#### [New Age - Free Bootstrap App Landing Page Theme](/themes/new-age "New Age - A Free Bootstrap App Landing Page Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">New Age - a free Bootstrap app landing page theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Originally created to be a landing page for people creating Bootstrap based websites for a mobile app or web app, New Age will be getting some major design updates in 2019. Look for a new, modern design style inspired by some of the most popular app landing pages out there, which will make the New Age theme truly worthy of its name!

#### [Landing Page - Free Bootstrap Landing Page Theme](/themes/landing-page "Landing Page - A Free Bootstrap Landing Page Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Landing Page - a free Bootstrap landing page theme</figcaption>
</figure>

One of the oldest landing page themes on Start Bootstrap, Landing Page got a bit of a design refresh last year, and it currently has risen in the ranks popularity-wise. In its current state, this theme is a great starting point for a lot of projects, and is going to be reimagined with its original design style in mind. Look for code quality updates and added functionality when this theme is rebuilt!

#### [One Page Wonder - Free Bootstrap One Page Website Theme](/themes/one-page-wonder "One Page Wonder - A Free Bootstrap One Page Website Theme by Start Bootstrap")

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">One Page Wonder - a free Bootstrap one page website theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Another diamond in the rough, One Page Wonder has a lot of potential. Originally inspired by the Spotify landing page, One Page Wonder works to pull off a bold, colorful, modern landing page look - but is falling a bit short in its current state. Look for a design update to this theme in 2019 which will make this theme a true wonder!

  <figcaption class="font-italic text-muted text-center">Agency - a free Bootstrap agency portfolio theme</figcaption>

Agency was originally based off of a design by FreebiesXpress. At the moment, we’re still happy with the general design and layout, and it’s still a great starting point for one page website projects. Minor updates to this free theme in 2019 might include code cleanup and some functionality updates.

</figure>

In the social-sphere, Resume has been pretty popular! Created live on Start Bootstrap’s Twitch channel, this theme was a request, and has certainly been performing well. It’s a perfect starting point for a quick resume site, and moving forward will be getting some slight updates in its code quality, and perhaps some small design modifications.

Clean Blog’s minimal flat design style has held up well over the years, and now has an official Jekyll version for great functionality with GitHub Pages. This theme is a perfect starting point for a Bootstrap based blog website, and will be getting a code review in 2019. New versions are also in the works, which include WordPress and Hugo!

Another one of Start Bootstrap's older themes, Stylish Portfolio got a major design update last year. At the moment, this theme is a great starting point for a portfolio website or personal website, and will be getting a code review later this year.

At the moment, Business Casual is Start Bootstrap’s only niche theme. The imagery and layout is all about coffee shops, but it’s a great theme for food and beverage websites, or anything retail based with some simple modification of the images. Some new functionality will be explored in the 2019 update for this theme as well as a code review.
