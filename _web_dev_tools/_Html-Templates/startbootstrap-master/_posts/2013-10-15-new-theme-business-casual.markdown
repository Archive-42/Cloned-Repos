Please welcome the newest addition to the Start Bootstrap library, ‘Business Casual!’ This template, once again, features some great photography by Death to the Stock Photo, and we did a few things that aren’t typical of your standard Start Bootstrap Template.

For starters, we tried to work with a bit of custom theme elements. We did a bit of work customizing the typography with this theme, and we made a few other customizations to give this template a bit more personality.

The two main features that really bring this template to life are the custom content boxes and the customized navigation bar. It’s still a standard bootstrap nav, but it sure doesn’t look like it! The boxes feature a bit of extra padding and a snowy, opaque background that blends well with an attractive background image.

This theme is a bit image-centric, so make sure you’re using a good background image that showcases the typography and custom content boxes. We recommend that you play around with fonts, since we’re still using the Bootstrap defaults in that area.

Anyways, we hope you enjoy this latest release! You can grab it over at <http://startbootstrap.com!>

Oh, and we haven’t forgotten about that admin template that has been requested by a lot of you. We’re working out a few bugs and finishing up the design. It’s going to be a good one, we hope!
