All of the free templates and themes on Start Bootstrap are now licensed under the MIT license instead of Apache 2.0.

The MIT license is simple, and it allows you to do just about anything you want with the templates.

In a nutshell, with the MIT license you can use any of the templates or themes on Start Bootstrap for commercial or private use, and you can distribute and/or modify the templates as you wish.

Every template on Start Bootstrap has a custom CSS file, and some have a custom JS file, which has a comment in the first few lines of code.

The whole point of Start Bootstrap is to remain open source, and to keep the templates and themes useable and extendable to a broad range of users. Switching to the MIT license is simply another step in this direction.
