Three years ago today I launched Start Bootstrap, and ever since it's been my mission to provide the web design community with quality, open source templates and themes. First off, I'd like to thank all of the visitors, users, and contributors that have passed through in the last few years because without you Start Bootstrap would be nothing like it is today!

Along with a shiny new design update to Start Bootstrap, I wanted to share with you some of the improvements and new content that will be coming in the next few months!

## Design Guides and Code Tutorials are Coming!

In the past, support for the content on Start Bootstrap has been limited to code comments, Disqus discussions, email requests, and GitHub issues - until now! I'm proud to announce that Start Bootstrap will begin publishing code tutorials to help educate designers and developers who are newer to Bootstrap or need help working with templates and themes. I'll also be releasing design guides which will offer techniques and inspiration for those who are looking to create Bootstrap websites with a unique look and feel!

I'll be elaborating a bit more on the structure of these new resources in a follow up post soon!

## New Themes

In addition to the guides and tutorials, there will also be some shiny new themes coming to Start Bootstrap! I've been listening to your suggestions on Twitter and via email, and I'll be creating versions of some frequently requested templates.

Alongside these new themes, current themes on Start Bootstrap will be updated as needed, which already started with Gulp and npm support on some of the more popular themes.

## Preparing for Bootstrap 4

Finally, Start Bootstrap is preparing for the impending release of Bootstrap 4. All templates and themes on Start Bootstrap will be updated to Bootstrap 4 once the new version is released, and don't worry the Bootstrap 3 versions will still be available via GitHub!

I hope you like the new design to the site, and make sure to keep an eye on Start Bootstrap in the coming months for some new themes along with tutorials and guides! The best way to stay informed is to follow Start Bootstrap on Twitter, or to subscribe to our mailing list and I'll send you updates when new content is available.

Until next time, happy coding!
