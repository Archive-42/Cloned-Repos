Have some questions? Need help customizing the theme you just downloaded? Want to collaborate with some fellow developers? Start Bootstrap's new public workspace on Slack is the perfect spot to discuss your projects!

<!--more-->

Making this public organization was super simple thanks to [Slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin), so a big thanks to the folks who created that open source tool!

Troubleshoot problems, ask questions, or just come and hang out! The workspace is a public forum for all to use. We have a general and a help channel to start us off!
