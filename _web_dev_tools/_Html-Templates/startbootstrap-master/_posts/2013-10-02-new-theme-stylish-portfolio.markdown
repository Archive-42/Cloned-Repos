We’ve just launched a new template to add to the Start Bootstrap mix. We are really excited about this one too. Announcing ‘Stylish Portfolio,’ the newest addition to the Start Bootstrap template library.

This template is packed with some awesome features. For starters, we took our 'Simple Sidebar’ template which has been pretty popular and modified it a little bit to work as a responsive, right side menu bar for this site.

Next, you will see that we are using some actual images this time. We’d like to thank Death to the Stock Photo for sending us these awesome images yesterday that we are using in this template. The header section features a full width and height image, and the dramatic text section somewhere near the middle of the page has a cool windowed effect to spy on that image as you scroll.

This template is born because of a suggestion sent to us at feedback@startbootstrap.com. If you have an idea that you would like to see come to life, please feel free to let us know!

Other than that, things are pretty straight forward. Download it, customize it, read our design suggestions, and have at it!

You can get our newest template - 'Stylish Portfolio’ on our website at <http://startbootstrap.com!> Enjoy!

We’ve got more templates in the pipeline, so be sure to keep checking back for more!
