We’ve fulfilled a promise we made a while back with the addition of our three newest templates. ‘3 Col Portfolio,’ '4 Col Portfolio,’ and 'Portfolio Item’ have been released to round out our portfolio template series.

So, to recap, our lineup of portfolio templates are as follows:

-   1 Col Portfolio
-   2 Col Portfolio
-   3 Col Portfolio
-   4 Col Portfolio
-   Portfolio Item

We now have a portfolio column style to fit any sort of project, so take a look at our different column layouts and get to customizing! From a design standpoint, we recommend using some unique hover effects for the images on the templates. Make it stylish, make it unique, and make it your own!

On the horizon: We will be releasing our pricing table as seen in 'Modern Business’ as a standalone template, as well as the FAQ page. Also, we’ve had a few requests for an Admin template, so that is our next project. We also have another full site template in the works, so make sure to follow us on Twitter and keep checking back for updates! Thanks everyone!
