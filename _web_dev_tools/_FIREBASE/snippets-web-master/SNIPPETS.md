# Generated Snippets	

## Overview	

The `snippets` directory contains snippets generated by the `separate-snippets` script.	
Snippets in this folder should **never** be updated directly instead please	
edit the source file (indicated by a comment at the top).	

## Regenerating the Snippets	

Run `npm run snippets` from the root of this repository.	

## Using the Separator	

For a file to be included in the separator script it must contain a comment like this:	

```js	
// [SNIPPETS_SEPARATION enabled]	
```	

By default separated snippets will have their name suffixed with `_modular`	
but you can override this with a commment:	

```js	
// [SNIPPETS_SUFFIX _banana]	
```
