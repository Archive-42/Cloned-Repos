# Escalivada

## Intro

Escalivada is typical from Catalunya.

## Ingredients

* 2 generous aubergines
* 4/5 red peppers
* 3/4 garlic cloves
* Olive oil
* vinegar
* salt

## How to do it

Pre-heat the oven at 180.

Give all the ingredients a good clean. With a knife remove the bottom of the peppers and get all the seeds out.

Wrap peppers and aubergines in kitchen foil (you can wrap 2 peppers together) and to the oven for 1 hour and a half. Turn them around every 30 minutes.

When done, take them out and let them cool off for easier cleaning, at least 45 minutes.

Peel the garlic and cut it as small as you can with the knife.

Now, put on an apron to peel off everything because it gets messy. When done cut it all small and into a big bowl.

Thrown in the garlic and start seasoning little by little to your taste (but don't be shy with the olive oil and the vinegar), stirring with a fork.

Done, now you can eat it as it is or cold from the fridge during the next 4/5 days.

## Tips and tricks

Since the oven is going to be on for a while, you might as well take the opportunity to roast a bunch of vegetables and eat them with the escalivada. Potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, cougerettes... 

Toast some bread and eat it with the escalivada on top. Add some manchego cheese for more extra awesome.

Escalivada goes really well with Spanish tortilla de patata or on the side of a steak.
