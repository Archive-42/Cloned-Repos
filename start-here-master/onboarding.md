# Onboarding

### Thoughts on the [***onboarding***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding) process.

The process of [***onboarding***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding)
new people into an organisation in _general_ and `developers` _specifically_
is one we've thought about _extensively_ and is the _purpose_ of the `start-here` repo!

We _openly_ acknowledge that (_besides a readme with links to other readmes_)
we are doing a _woefully poor_ job of getting people "_up-to-speed_" in our org/team ... ðŸ˜¢  
(_even though this is the single **highest value task** we can perform!_)


> It would be _great_ to get other people's thoughts on the process from the
various perspectives you've had working in _several_ different organisations.
Have you ever worked somewhere that had a "_bullet-proof_" _step-by-step_
process for new people joining a team/org?

## Why?

Making people _feel_ loved/included and part of the community/team _instantly_
is the goal of the `start-here` repository.

_After_ we have _explained_ our _mission_ and people are _keen_ to
get started, we need to have an _unambiguous process_.


## What?

Make people _feel_ welcome, loved and empowered to get started without delay!

People joining DWYL are `family` and want them to _feel_ like DWYL is their `home`.

## How?

The success of the new person (_and continued thriving of the existing team which new person has joined_) depends on several factors.

1. Make the person feel welcome. Aim to make them feel like it's their _Birthday_ and everyone is celebrating! :tada:
5. [**Understand**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpNbW9MAarQ) the person on a _personal_ level: what makes them "_tick_"?
Only by understanding a person's _intrinsic motivations_ can you hope to work well with them.
4. **Contextualize** and give the "Brief History of ..." so they _know_ "where we came from".
1. Introduce the person to all the relevant people in the org/team they are going to need to speak to and why.
9. Reserve Time in the calendars of all necessary people (_preferably the week before the new person starts_) so that they can get the necessary 1:1 or team-time.
2. Give the person the **tools** they need to get started without delay. see: https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/131
3. Show the person the knowledge repository they will need before they can be productive: https://github.com/dwyl?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=learn
6. Ensure the person has a complete knowledge of our Why? What? and How?
6. Help the person pick a task to start with from the backlog.
10. Encourage the new person to ask as many questions as they need to by searching through existing knowledge base and posting fresh questions (_to which they did not find an adequate answer during their initial search_)
