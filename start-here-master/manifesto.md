# Manifesto

***Everyone*** *should* be doing something they *love*.

In *everything* we do, we follow [**The Golden Rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule):

> "treat others as one would like others to treat oneself"

### Your time should never be wasted.
 We believe everything *we* do should _Save. You. Time_ which you can then spend doing the things you love (you know, the ones you never have time for...).    

 <a name="simple"/>

### Keep it simple
 Poor planning and lack of modularity are the mothers of bloated apps. If how you go about doing something in the app isn’t _obvious_, then it needs to be changed.

### Community driven

We have a lot of ideas for great ways the app can help you track your time, become more productive and more organised (based on the [latest science](#latest-science)), but we don’t want to [give you something you don’t want](#no-forced-updates) so we’ll be asking you for your thoughts before we start working on new features. Everything we put out into the world will be voted on by you, the people who use our app. And we hope that once you start using it, [you’ll have some great ideas](http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/democ1.htm) of things you’d like to see built into the app and we can vote on those as a community too.

### Your data is yours
 Which means we don’t sell it. We [don’t use it to study you without your knowledge or consent](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-689003-users-emotions-for-science/). We don’t give it to your boss. It’s your information and you are in control of who sees any given portion of it and how it’s used ([simply and easily](#simple), not hidden behind a mass of complicated menus).
<a name="community"/>

### Environmental love

 No company should be anything short of carbon neutral. The fact that we exist will be positive for the environment, not a detriment.

### Accessibility

Whilst we don’t know _exactly_ what this is going to look like yet, we’re counting on our community of users to let us know exactly what they need from day 1.

### _Full_ transparency

We’re aware this may seem crazy, but we want to be fully transparent about everything we do, from [making decisions](#community) to finances :open_mouth: We’re an open book :book:

<a name="OS"/>

### Open source, always
We don’t hide our code away. If you want to contribute to it, please do. If you want to use it as the starting point for something else, that’s fine too - just please give us some kudos for the hard work we’ve put in :relieved:

<a name="latest-science"/>

### The latest science
We’ll draw on the most interesting, important and relevant scientific research to help you improve your productivity.

### Revenue funded
We want to grow organically, at the right pace for us and to be flexible enough to move in the direction the [community](#community) wants to take us.

### Simple API
The most easy-to-use API means you can quickly integrate the _time app_ features into your own websites, apps and internal flows. If it makes you more productive, we’re [happy for you to use it](#OS)

<a name="people-not-users"/>

### We do not have users, [we have _people_](https://github.com/ideaq/time/issues/33).

<a name="loyalty-first"/>

### Reward loyalty, not sign ups
If we're giving out puppies, we're giving them to the people who've been with us from the start. [We're _**not**_ giving them out to new people and charging existing people for the privilege](https://twitter.com/iteles/status/561589203272994818).

<a name="no-forced-updates"/>

### No forced updates
I hate it when I love the way an app is now and then it forces me to update to a new version where they have ruined the experience by trying to get the app to do too much and bloated the UI. _Don't you?_ Our plan is to keep things modular enough that if you :heart: the way the app looks now, you can keep it just the way you want it but still access new features.

### No 'exit strategy'
[@nelsonic](https://github.com/nelsonic) wrote an _excellent_ summary of why we
have no plans to _sell_ the organisation to anyone and why that is important to us: https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/189 .
