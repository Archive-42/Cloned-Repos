# Remove-Runspace

## SYNOPSIS

Remove a runspace from your session.

## SYNTAX

### id (Default)

```yaml
Remove-Runspace [-ID] <Int32> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### runspace

```yaml
Remove-Runspace [-Runspace] <Runspace> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

When working with PowerShell, you may discover that some commands and scripts can leave behind runspaces. You may even deliberately be creating additional runspaces. These runspaces will remain until you exit your PowerShell session. Or use this command to cleanly close and dispose of runspaces. You cannot remove any runspace with an availability of Busy or that is already closing.

This command does not write anything to the pipeline.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-Runspace -id 18 -WhatIf
What if: Performing the operation "Remove-Runspace" on target "18 - Runspace18".
```

Show what would have happened to remove runspace with an ID of 18.

### Example 2

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-Runspace | where ID -gt 1 | Remove-Runspace
```

Get all runspaces with an ID greater than 1, which is typically your session, and remove the runspace.
