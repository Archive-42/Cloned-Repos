# Test-ExpressionForm

## SYNOPSIS

Display a graphical test form for Test-Expression.

## SYNTAX

```yaml
Test-ExpressionForm [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This command will display a WPF-based form that you can use to enter in testing information. Testing intervals are in seconds. All of the values are then passed to the Test-Expression command. Results will be displayed in the form. The results only show you how long the tests took, regardless of whether or not there were errors.

When you close the form, the last result object will be passed to the pipeline, including all metadata, the scriptblock, and arguments.

This command requires a Windows platform that supports WPF.
