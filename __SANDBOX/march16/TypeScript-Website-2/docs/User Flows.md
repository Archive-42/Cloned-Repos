The thinking about how we structure linking throughout the docs.

# New user

This is a range of people, but it covers someone who has just started programming to an experienced programmer who is interested in understanding a new language.
For them, the TypeScript website is exploratory.

## On desktop

On a desktop, you're doing deeper learning usually, with a specific goal in mind.

Four main user goals:

- Understand what TypeScript is
- Try TypeScript
- Install TypeScript
- Learn the language

#### Understand

- Homepage
- Homepage Footer -> Why TypeScript
- Homepage -> Handbook

#### Install

- Homepage Header -> Download
- Homepage -> Install Locally -> Download

#### Try

- Homepage -> Try it out -> Examples -> Install -> Playground
- Homepage -> Install Locally -> Tutorials -> Install -> Playground
- Homepage -> Learn

#### Learn

- Homepage -> Learn

## On Mobile

On mobile the first user experience is oriented towards shallow learning ('what is this typescript thing?' and learning enough to know that you'd want to come back with an IDE)

Two main user goals:

- Understand what TypeScript is
- Learn a bit of the language

#### Understand

- Homepage
- Homepage -> Why TypeScript

#### Learn

- Homepage -> Download -> Learn
- Homepage -> Learn
