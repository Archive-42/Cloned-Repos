display: "Linter Checks"
---

A collection of extra checks, which somewhat cross the boundaries of compiler vs linter. You may prefer to use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#typescript-eslint">eslint</a> over these options if you are looking for more in-depth rules.
