TypeScript strives to only include features which are confirmed to be added into the JavaScript language.

There have been cases where a feature is compelling enough to be an exception to that rule, and these live as experimental compiler flags.
It is possible that a version of these features may be different when/if they are added to the JavaScript language, and thus are considered risky.
