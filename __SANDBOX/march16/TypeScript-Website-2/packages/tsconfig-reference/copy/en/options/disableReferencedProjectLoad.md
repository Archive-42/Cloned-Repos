display: "disableReferencedProjectLoad"
oneline: "Reduce the number of projects loaded automatically by TypeScript."
---

In multi-project TypeScript programs, TypeScript will load all of the available projects into memory in order to provide accurate results for editor responses which require a full knowledge graph like 'Find All References'.

If your project is large, you can use the flag `disableReferencedProjectLoad` to disable the automatic loading of all projects. Instead, projects are loaded dynamically as you open files through your editor.
