**Default**: The longest common path of all non-declaration input files. If `composite` is set, the default is instead the directory containing the `tsconfig.json` file.

When TypeScript compiles files, it keeps the same directory structure in the output directory as exists in the input directory.

For example, let's say you have some input files:

```
MyProj
├── tsconfig.json
├── core
│   ├── a.ts
│   ├── b.ts
│   ├── sub
│   │   ├── c.ts
├── types.d.ts
```

The inferred value for `rootDir` is the longest common path of all non-declaration input files, which in this case is `core/`.

If your `outDir` was `dist`, TypeScript would write this tree:

```
MyProj
├── dist
│   ├── a.js
│   ├── b.js
│   ├── sub
│   │   ├── c.js
```

However, you may have intended for `core` to be part of the output directory structure.
By setting `rootDir: "."` in `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript would write this tree:

```
MyProj
├── dist
│   ├── core
│   │   ├── a.js
│   │   ├── b.js
│   │   ├── sub
│   │   │   ├── c.js
```

Importantly, `rootDir` **does not affect which files become part of the compilation**.
It has no interaction with the `include`, `exclude`, or `files` `tsconfig.json` settings.

Note that TypeScript will never write an output file to a directory outside of `outDir`, and will never skip emitting a file.
For this reason, `rootDir` also enforces that all files which need to be emitted are underneath the `rootDir` path.

For example, let's say you had this tree:

```
MyProj
├── tsconfig.json
├── core
│   ├── a.ts
│   ├── b.ts
├── helpers.ts
```

It would be an error to specify `rootDir` as `core` _and_ `include` as `*` because it creates a file (`helpers.ts`) that would need to be emitted _outside_ the `outDir` (i.e. `../helpers.js`).
