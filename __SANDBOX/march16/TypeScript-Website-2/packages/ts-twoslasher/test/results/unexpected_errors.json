Errors were thrown in the sample, but not included in an errors tag: 2588

Expected:
// @errors: 2588

  [2588] - Cannot assign to 'myVariable' because it is a constant.

## Code

'''ts
// @target: ES2015

// Because this example doesn't have an errors
// reference it will throw

const myVariable = ""
myVariable = 1
