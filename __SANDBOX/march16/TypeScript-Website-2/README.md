### Getting Started

This repo uses [yarn workspaces][y-wrk] with node 13+, and [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html). (Windows users can install [watchman via chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/watchman))

With those set up, clone this repo and run `yarn install`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-website
cd TypeScript-website
yarn install
code .

# Then:
yarn bootstrap
# Optional, grab the translations:
yarn docs-sync pull microsoft/TypeScript-Website-localizations#main 1

# Now you can start up the website
yarn start
```

Working on this repo is done by running `yarn start` - this starts up the website on port `8000` and creates a
builder worker for every package in the repo, so if you make a change outside of the site it will compile and lint etc.

Some useful knowledge you need to know:

- All packages have: `yarn build` and `yarn test`
- All packages use [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) - which means you can do `env DEBUG="*" yarn test` to get verbose logs

You can manually via GH Actions for [production here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Monday+Website+Push+To+Production%22) and [staging here](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Website+To+Staging%22).

Having issues getting set up? [Consult the troubleshooting](./docs/Setup%20Troubleshooting.md).

## Deployment

Deployment is automatic:

- Pushes to the branch `v2` deploy to [staging](http://www.staging-typescript.org)
- On a Monday the v2 branch is deployed to [production](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

You can find the build logs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/actions)

## Docs

If you want to know _in-depth_ how this website works, there is an [hour long video covering the codebase, deployment and tooling on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOvivt6B7hE). Otherwise there are some short guides:

- [Converting Twoslash Code Samples](./docs/Converting%20Twoslash%20Code%20Samples.md)
- [How i8n Works For Site Copy](./docs/How%20i8n%20Works%20For%20Site%20Copy.md)
- [Updating the TypeScript Version](./docs/New%20TypeScript%20Version.md)
- [Something Went Wrong](./docs/Something%20Went%20Wrong.md)

# Website Packages

## TypeScriptLang-Org

The main website for TypeScript, a Gatsby website which is statically deployed. You can run it via:

```sh
yarn start
```

To save your time, twoslash is not applied to code-samples in `yarn start` - to launch the server with twoslash support use: `yarn start-twoslash`.
To optimize even more, the env var `NO_TRANSLATIONS` as truthy will make the website only load pages for English.

## Sandbox

The editor aspect of the TypeScript Playground REPL, useable for all sites which want to show a monaco editor
with TypeScript or JavaScript code.

## Playground

The JS code has an AMD module for the playground which is loaded at runtime in the Playground website.

# Doc Packages

## TSConfig Reference

A set of tools and scripts for generating a comprehensive API reference for the TSConfig JSON file.

```sh
# Generate JSON from the typescript cli
yarn workspace tsconfig-reference run generate-json
# Jams them all into a single file
yarn workspace tsconfig-reference run generate-markdown
```

Validate the docs:

```sh
yarn workspace tsconfig-reference run test

# or to just run the linter without a build
yarn workspace tsconfig-reference run lint

# or to just one one linter for a single doc
yarn workspace tsconfig-reference run lint resolveJson
```

## Documentation

The docs for TypeScript. Originally ported over from [microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/) then intermingled with [microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook), and finally updated for [Twoslash](http://www.staging-typescript.org/dev/twoslash/) and with new content.

## Playground Examples

The code samples used in the Playground split across many languages.

# Infra Packages

Most of these packages use [`tsdx`](https://tsdx.io).

## TS Twoslash

A code sample markup extension for TypeScript. Available on npm: [@typescript/twoslash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/twoslash)

## TypeScript VFS

A comprehensive way to run TypeScript projects in-memory in a browser or node environment. Available on npm: [@typescript/vfs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/vfs)

## Create Playground Plugin

A template for generating a new playground plugin which you can use via `npm init playground-plugin [name]`

## Handbook Epub

Generates an epub file from the handbook files. You can try downloading it at http://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/typescript-handbook.epub

## Community Meta

Generates contributions JSON metadata on who edited handbook pages.
