# Apps vs Documents on the web

The future direction of the web is a constant battle-ground between two sets of folks. 

Those who believe the web platform is for shipping app-like experiences (PWAs, [Chome's Project Fugu](http://www.chromium.org/teams/web-capabilities-fugu), "WASM will replace JS") vs those who think of the web as a document store ("[Progressive enhancement](https://alistapart.com/article/progressiveenhancementwithjavascript/) for JS", [stimulus.js](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev), and to a reasonable extent the people pushing for more Server-Side Rendering of JS)
