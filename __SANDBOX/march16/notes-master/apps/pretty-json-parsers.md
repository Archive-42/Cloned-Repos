### Pretty JSON Parsers

In helping to move [Artsy to React Native](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/), I came to the conclusion that our native app was just a pretty JSON parser. 

Outside of games, I'd argue that most native apps are pretty JSON parsers. Which is why things like React Native and Flutter which are better toolchains for making those kind of apps are making such strong inroads. Pretty JSON Parser favour code which is easy to change, fast to iterate and very high level code.
