# Yarn vs npm

> "Use yarn, mostly v1, embrace workspaces"

When I clone a JS/TS repo and it's not using yarn I usually assume the repo came from someone new to the JS ecosystem. Yarn came out a few years ago and npm is still playing catch-up on features. Originally a Facebook project, but nowadays is ran by non-Facebook folks. Over time, Yarn was re-written and focused on solving different problems than I am seeing.

The npm contributors at the time probably considered creating Yarn a hostile move, but it offered a lot of features that were essential for reliably building apps. People in the JS ecosystem had dependency trees which were easily thousands of deps big but didn't even have a lockfile, bonkers. 

IMO, Yarn is the CLI developer experience I think all other bundler/dependency manager CLI's should strive for.

### Great features

- [[yarn-workspaces]] - is a great want to handle multiple contexts in one repo
- `yarn upgrade-interactive` is very impressive, especially when you have dependency trees the size of nodejs projects
- The way that you can write [`yarn tsc` to run TypeScript](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/279#issuecomment-748102000) from your local dependencies is reason enough to use yarn's CLI even in npm projects  
- [`"resolutions"`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) - solves huge JS dep tree problems very elegantly

#### Yarn 1 vs npm 7

To be honest, enough changed in npm 7 that I'm not sure how many of my original arguments on yarn vs npm still hold. I've not upgraded locally in part because their [`peerDependencies`](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/) change, and in other part because I don't use npm already and I think the CLI experience is worse. [`npm exec`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-exec) is a good step forwards though. So now you can do:

```sh
$ yarn tap --bail test/foo.js
# vs
$ npm exec -- tap --bail test/foo.js
```

Still not focused, but better than before  which used a completely different command: `npx`.

#### Yarn 1 vs 2+

The userbase of yarn is split because yarn 2 focused heavily on trying to remove the `node_modules` folder [with zero installs](https://next.yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs/) for [PNP](https://next.yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) which was probably a mistake. Using PNP means yarn overriding the `require` statement which moves the node_modules into tar files in your repo. The tar files can then be put into your source control.

I think people started to adopt yarn 2 once the team were very explicit that you could avoid Zero Installs & PNP. Both of these ideas do solve real problems, but its trade-offs aren't worth it (personally) and I would have still `.gitignored` it's version of the `node_modules` somewhat negating ~~the whole~~ [some](https://twitter.com/arcanis/status/1364546285865418756) of the point.

I've only moved two projects to yarn 2 (the TypeScript Website and my games) and I don't really gain much. On the net, it was probably a bit more of a negative but I needed some practical experience to make an opinion. After switching, I've got more random files in my repo (yarn config to remove PNP, the JS for the yarn 2 version, the JS for plugins) which I wouldn't have had I stayed on v1, my most used commands (outside of `yarn install`) were moved to [plugins](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website/tree/v2/.yarn/plugins/%40yarnpkg) which I guess shows that my usage falls away from the mainstream and the CLI output is an improvement (colour usage and logical grouping :+1:) [~~and some negative "YN0000" et al~~](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/2513).

One thing that switching to yarn 2 did which I think was a real positive was a stricter sense of enforcing dependencies across workspaces. For example if one project brought in a dependency, you had to be very explicit that it would be used in that a workspace and it would not be available in other workspaces. Think of it as if you had 3 workspaces, and only one of them included `"typescript"` - then `tsc` would not be available in other workspaces. On top of that, if I were using PNP, that validation would also occur during a `require`. This requirement definitely tightened up the interlinking in the TypeScript monorepo. If it was a complex workspace with a lot of contributors, that's a very big win for safe deploys.

That said, I'd love to use yarn 2 everywhere because the plugin system for v2 is compelling. I'd like to build [yarn-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev)) but it'd require moving any projects to use v2 before I can use the plugin (and the plugin would need wide-adoption to be useful) which makes it not worth putting the time in to build. 

#### Yarn 1 vs PNPM

I've made a few repos with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org) to get a sense of whether pnpm could be a replacement for yarn 1 for me. There's some interesting ideas in there. I wasn't a particular fan of having workspace config in it's own yml file vs the `package.json` but that's pretty minor, but it copies npm's CLI experience for running scripts/binaries instead of yarn's which is more of a blocker. So, I've started a discussion about [potentially moving](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/discussions/3191).

#### Future

Yarn 2+ is unlikely to be compelling enough to warrant all the extra files in every repo considering how yarn 1 works perfectly well for the task of getting deps, setting up complex projects and running commands with a great experience. 

It's important to note that the yarn team are OSS folks solving problems they want to solve, and their choice of direction is totally cool with me. I know what it's like to lead large OSS software projects and any decision at this scale are always trade-offs for different portions of their users. My workflow is my workflow, and the grooves of that workflow came from extended usage of yarn 1 everywhere. I think both are great software. It is not that yarn 2 sucks, it's that the default is yarn 1 and yarn 1 works really well. The migration to v2 and keep a similar set of behaviors requires some extra work and files which don't pay for themselves enough to be done consistently.

Because using the command `yarn` defaults to v1 when you install node, then nearly all of the time I'll be using that version. On the long run this is a tad worrying because v1 isn't getting updates and support anymore. Though sometimes the lack of change can be a good thing. My plan is to generally stick with v1 in nearly every repo unless I see a really compelling reason to change.

To imagine what would move yarn 2+ to be my everyday package manager: 

 - Ship `yarn` like a normal module where the version you have is the latest
 - Make the `node_modules` linker be default behavior out of the box
 - Make running `yarn install` only add a lockfile by default

This means you get a 'traditional' / 'works how node works' / 'loose' setup for most projects and give folks the chance to opt-in to more restrictive and powerful options. This pattern works well for TypeScript, people migrate to strict in bigger projects all the time. 

( It'd be _nice_ to have the interactive plugins as default, but the workspaces one I can live with installing when needed in a monorepo. )

Again, I respect the Yarn team's choices to _not_ do this, making these call would be going back on what I think they consider the value of yarn itself when they shipped v2. For me, the value of yarn has been a great UI, fast download/installer, a solid resolver which avoids dupes and with later releases on workspace support. This echoes what I wrote a few months before [Yarn 1.0 came out](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Front-end-JavaScript-at-Artsy-2017/#Yarn).

Worth thinking about:  An interesting side-effect from v1's the lack of updates, it's possible that npm will now catch up with yarn 1. npm 7 has taken a lot of the good features of yarn 1 and within a few years maybe we'll see experienced JS folks people move back to npm.
