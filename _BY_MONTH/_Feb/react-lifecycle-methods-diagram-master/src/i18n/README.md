# Translation module

## Usage of the translation module

See [React-T](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-t) for documentation.

## How to add new language

1. Add a new JSON file named with by language's [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), e.g. `pt-BR.json`. [A list of common codes](https://github.com/libyal/libfwnt/wiki/Language-Code-identifiers#0x0400---0x04ff) may come in handy.
2. Take one of the previously set up JSONs to copy all the keys of the strings that need translations and fill in your JSON with translated phrases.
3. In `i18n.js`, add JSON file to the list of imports in `languageFiles`, e.g. `'pt-BR': () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "pt-BR" */ './json/pt-BR.json'),`.
4. Verify that strings are loaded correctly by running the project locally.

## How it works

`getMatchingLocale` function returns a locale that is a preferred one for the current user based on browser settings. A matching JSON language file is dynamically imported. Once it's loaded, the original phrase is replaced by T component with the translated one, provided that it was defined in a proper JSON file.
