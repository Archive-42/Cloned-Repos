# Mission

People with a clearly communicated `Mission`
are more likely to achieve their aim. <br />

There is a clear correlation
between having a _concise_ mission
and the _successful outcome_
of the people
focussed on achieving it.
In many cases feats
previously considered "_impossible_" are achieved
in _unbelievably_ short timelines.


## Context

We have always had a
["_Why_?"](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here#why)
goal (_or several goals depending on who you ask_) for @dwyl.

_Long_ before we started @dwyl we had been working for charities
and non-profit organisations on a variety of missions
including poverty reduction, cancer research, homelessness,
fair trade and education.

One of the things that became clear to us
while we were working for various charities
and for-profit businesses
was that in _most_ cases time was not used effectively
and communication channels were poor.
Even though mission statements were clear,
_translating_ those words into the day-to-day actions
that most _effectively_ achieved the mission
was severely lacking in most cases.



## _However ..._

Even though our **`start-here`** repo has been read and "_starred_" by _many_ people:

![start-here-stars-sept-2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/65373907-8b706d80-dc7b-11e9-8f6b-d844b9a975c8.png)

(_evidence that there is **some clarity** in our **purpose**_)

We still feel that we are doing a _poor_ job of _communicating_ the **`Mission`**
to the extent that people have _asked_ us to clarify it.[<sup>2</sup>](#notes)

Our objective with defining a _single_ clear **`Mission`** for the organisation is to help _everyone_ in the community/team _understand exactly_ what we are trying to achieve and how much _effort_ and _perseverance_ it will require along the way.

# What is _@dwyl's_ `Mission`?

### "_Empower people to maximise effectiveness, creativity and happiness._"

Our App and Community should help people
to discover meaningful creative work.
We should proactively share all our learning and knowledge
and encourage everyone else to do the same
so that we can accelerate progress
and build a better future together.

## _Most_ People are Disengaged from the Work they Do ...


According to recent data, only 13% of employees (Worldwide)
are engaged at work. A whopping **87%** are **_disengaged_**.
People who are disengaged are _definitely_ not
being _effective_ with their time
or laser focussed on any mission.

> [![employee-engagement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/52519733-2457f880-2c58-11e9-8f4d-32f4328ccab1.png)](https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k)

> "_I believe in a future,
> where the **value** of your work
> is not determined by the size of your paycheque,
> but by the amount of **happiness** you **spread**
> and the amount of **meaning** you give.
> I believe in a future
> where the **point** of education

but a **right** we **all deserve**._"
> ~ [Rutger Bregman](https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k?t=841)

We feel this is a huge problem
because the lives of _hundreds of millions_ of people
are being wasted doing meaningless jobs.
We want to help people find
and focus their time
on highly meaningful creative work.

We need to find people who _share_ our mission
and collaborate on work that we _love_.

## A Clear Mission: Moon Landing

On May 25, 1961
President John F. Kennedy stood before Congress,
and proposed that the US
"_should commit itself to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,
of landing a man on the Moon
and returning him safely to the Earth_".

[![jfk-congress-moon-goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/65376387-06934d00-dc97-11e9-871a-c32340d061c2.png)](https://youtu.be/GmN1wO_24Ao "JFK Congress Speech")

President John F. Kennedy
_clearly_ defined the _mission_ to go to the Moon.
Landing on the Moon was
_far_ beyond the capability of the time.
America had yet to successfully launch
_anything_ into orbit.


[![we-choose-to-go-to-the-moon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/65367909-ef217900-dc30-11e9-803d-7bb9f77dfe1c.png)](https://youtu.be/WZyRbnpGyzQ "President Kennedy's Speech at Rice University")


> _**We choose** to **go to** the **Moon**!_[<sup>1</sup>](#notes) <br />
"_We choose to go to the Moon in this decade
and do the other things, **not because** they are **easy**,
**but because** they are **hard**;
because that **goal** will serve to **organize** and **measure**
the **best** of our **energies** and **skills**, because that **challenge**
is one that we are willing to **accept**,
one we are **unwilling** to **postpone**,
and one **we intend to win**, and the others,
too._" <br />

Less than 7 years later, on 20 July 1969,
Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing <br />

What is often overlooked is the fact that JFK was killed
in November 22, 1963
_long_ before the space program
had achieved any meaningful progress.
Despite the demise of JFK,
the mission to reach the Moon was still achieved.
Over 400,000 people were involved in the
The power of a good mission is that it
transcends the leader who defined it.

SpaceX has a similarly clear mission: https://www.spacex.com/about

They too have managed feats most experts thought were impossible
including many records for a privately developed liquid-fueled rocket.

> "_I'm trying to construct a world that maximises the probability that SpaceX continues its mission without me_". Elon Musk

Even if you aren't interested in (_or are **against**_) space exploration,
one thing is _undeniable_:
the people at SpaceX are _executing_ on their mission.
SpaceX's [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com) project
will bring cheap and high speed broadband internet access
to the
[next billion people](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674983786).
This will be _game changing_ to global development
because people with access to information/knowledge/education
can _dramatically_ improve their own lives
without north-western aid (_handouts_).

The point of mentioning Space exploration here
is simply to highlight what is _possible_ <br />
when a clear mission is combined with smart people.

> "_It is possible for ordinary people
to choose to be extraordinary_.‚Äù
~ [Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7221234.Elon_Musk)

By comparison to launching reusable rockets,
what _we_ are building is a _lot easier_! <br />
Building web applications is _definitely_ not "rocket surgery".

that software development is _difficult_,
you are almost certainly over-thinking it;

## Notes

> <sup>1</sup> Moon...? üåî
Don't _worry_, @dwyl is not "pivoting"
to become a "space exploration" company!
We have neither the expertise
nor the _desire_ to burn our energy/time
on _leaving_ Earth
when there is still so much to be _done_
for to help people and planet!
We aren't _against_ space exploration,
in fact we are _delighted_ that it exists!
We are _grateful_ for
[GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System),
[Teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene)
and
[Velcro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook-and-loop_fastener)
all of which we have the
["space race"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race)
to thank for enabling or popularising!
Going to the Moon is a _good_ example
of a clear mission which is
both **_incredibly_ ambitious** and ***inspiring***.
**`While`** we feel it's a _good_ thing certain
[Billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45919650)
are re-investing some of their wealth into space exploration
(_e.g: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson_),
because they are advancing technology in many fields
as a result and _inspiring_ a **`new`** generation
of people into science and engineering,
we _wish_ more of the "mega rich"
would re-invest their hoards of cash into
[poverty](https://youtu.be/ydKcaIE6O1k) alleviation
_first_ instead of
mega [_yachts_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_yachts_by_length)
to [overcompensate](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=overcompensating)
for their [insecurities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_security).

> <sup>2</sup>A member of the team recently asked
"_Has dwyl's name/ meaning changed?_"
[hq/issues/519](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/519)
(_we are **stoked** that the person had the
**courage** to **ask** the **question**,
because it helped **confirm** our **suspicion**
that we were **not communicating**
our **`Mission`** **effectively**..._) <br />
We've _attempted_ to capture our **`Mission`**
**`before`**:
[issues/116](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/116)
but sadly there was a miscommunication
that lead to the issue being _closed_
without any _progress_,
that was a _unfortunate_. üòï <br />
Rather than re-open an issue
that has a lot of "_baggage_",
we are capturing our thoughts directly in this file. üå±
There is also some insight into our mission
in
[issues/108](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/108)
as noted by @newswim in
[issues/116](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/116#issuecomment-280011877)
Anyone interested in going through the old threads,
go for it! üîç `#hypertransparency`
My goal here
is to ***summarise*** our quest
to _define_ @dwyl's **`Mission`**
and _update_ the **`start-here/README.md`**
in order to **clarify** it for **`new`** people.
