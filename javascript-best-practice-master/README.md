A collection of JavaScript Best Practices

![Fit vs Fat](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/javascript-best-practice/master/images/fit-vs-fat.jpg "Fit vs Fat")

Much like being in shape, 
writing *consistent*, *maintainable* and *performant* code
does not have to be "*aspiration*", its a *decision* we make
and stick to. If you see someone writing junk, share this with them! 


## Short List

1. *Use* the “**Good Parts**” (and *avoid* the “*Bad parts*”)
2. **Clear**, **Concise** and **Commented** Code
3. **Meaningful Variable Names** (Especially as Parameters)
4. *Avoid* **Global** Variables
5. Use **JSLint** to ensure your code is consistent.
6. *Always* **Unit Test** your Code (even for simple/quick fixes and one-liners)
7. *Learn* (“Real”/”Raw”) JavaScript (fundamentals) before using Libraries like JQuery/Backbone
8. Avoid Libraries/Modules/Frameworks until you *understand* them, especially when they are un-tested/documented `if(tests===false) alert(“Don’t use it!”)` 
9. **Never Commit**/Ship **Broken**/Buggy **Code** even when “PMs” Pressure You!
10. Its only “**Done**” when its “**Documented**”.

## Extra Mile

11. <del>Learn **CoffeeScript** it will Set you Free!</del>
12. Learn & Use **Patterns**
13. (Don’t be afraid to) *Critique* someone else’s code if they ignore any coding best practices (by pointing to the *specific* “guideline” that is not being followed)
14. Compile your code with **Source Maps** (to aid debugging)

My ambition is to write a *system* that *automatically* reviews ("*lints*") 
JavaScript code while you are writing it and rejects code that does 
*not adhere* to these best practices.

## Recommendations from Maintainable JavaScript

Maintainable JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010) has *many* **practical** 
JavaScript best practices. 
I *highly recommend* you **buy & read** his **book**:
http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/


### Indentation

Indentation should be **four spaces** *not tabs*.

```javascript
// Good
if (true) {
    makePandaHappy();
}
```

### Line Length

Lines should be *no longer* than **80 characters**. 
Lines which go over 80 char should be wrapped after an operator (e.g. comma). 
The **continuation** line should be *indented* **two levels** (8 chars).

```javascript
// Good
registerNewUser(firstName, lastName, emailAddress, password,
        preferredLanguage);

// Bad: Continuation line only indented four spaces
registerNewUser(firstName, lastName, emailAddress, password,
    preferredLanguage);

registerNewUser(firstName, lastName, emailAddress, password
        , preferredLanguage);
```
**Note**: there are plenty of advocates for "Leading Comma" or "Trailing Comma"
see: http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?6796-Leading-comma-or-Trailing-comma-that-is-the-question.

### Primitive Literals

#### Strings

Always use double quotes and span a single line.

```javascript
// Good
var message = "Welcome to JayessVille!";

// Bad: Single Quotes
var message = 'single quotes confuse. avoid';
```

## CoffeeScript

I am a *huge fan* of CoffeeScript's elegance and simplicity.
But its not as popular as I would have liked. :-(

![Easy to Write Hard to Read](http://i.imgur.com/usNKZRt.png "CoffeeScript Discussion")

I actually find CoffeeScript incredibly *easy* to read (*practice*?) but I *agree*
with [@pgte](https://github.com/pgte) its harder to get contributions from others
for open source projects if they are written in CoffeeScript, simply because not
that many people know the language! :-(

I still recommend you *learn* coffeescript, its *so* **much** more fun to write
and (with *practice*) read than JavaScript! And for small teams where everyone
learns it, CoffeeScript wipes the floor with JavaScript!

## Small Stack of Best Books

While I'm a **strong advocate** of **learning by doing**, 
*sometimes* it *pays* to learn from the knowledge/mistakes of
more experienced people by reading the books they have written...

I keep a *small stack* of the best titles on my desk to recommend to my
"*junior*" developers:

If you live in London and can't afford to buy books, message me on 
[LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nelsonic),
I'm happy to *give* you any of my books in exchange for *insights*. :-)


### Test Driven Development - Writing Reliable Code

If you are not doing Test Driven Development (TDD), you officially an amateur; go do your *homework*!
But seriously, testing is *easy* and will give you *confidence* in the code you have written. 

Writing comprehensive tests allows you to refactor your code as you learn how to do things more efficiently (natural progression - you’re meant to keep learning; honing your craft!) and can build on your existing codebase without fear of breaking existing (decoupled) modules.

There are a wide range of options for testing JavaScript:
See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/300855/looking-for-a-better-javascript-unit-test-tool 

I recommend reading http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321683919/ and http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449323391/ to get a good understanding of the available options.

I have used:
- Vows: http://vowsjs.org/
- Mocha: http://mochajs.org/
- Jasmine: https://jasmine.github.io/
- Chai: http://chaijs.com/ 
- JS-Test-Driver: https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/
- NodeJS Assert (core module): http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html 

And of these I favor Jasmine for its Simplicity. (but always keep open mind if someone has experience of others)

### History

This originally started out in a Google Doc:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9msoVNY5KlRnHeIAgUgqDyaXh2Q35v5zHtdpZ2vy-U
I created it to share/suggest best practices with my team of developers.
The idea was that all developers in the company could edit the doc and a 
generally agreed code for writing code could be established.

The *reality* was that I was the only one who even *looked* at the Google Doc!
Nobody made any comments or contributions. :-(
*Too "Busy"* coding to stop and think: "*Is my code consistent...?*" or 
"*Is this maintainable by someone else?*" ... This is not the time or place 
to voice my *frustration* at trying to get people in an established 
organisation (with more **bad habits** than you can *imagine*) to adopt 
industry best practices for JavaScript code. 
Each to their own. 

Its time to put this up on GitHub for a wider audience to access. ;-)
