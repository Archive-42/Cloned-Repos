## Python Equality Operator  

The equality operator (==) compares two values and returns True if they're equivalent or False if they are not.  
Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.

```
>>> a = 3
>>> b = 3
>>> a == b
True
>>> a == 4
False
>>> b == 3
True
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**In the console there is a function named equality with a single argument named value.**  
**The function contains an incomplete if/else statement.**
**Complete the if statement so that the string "Equal to 12" will be returned when the variable value is equivalent to 12.**
