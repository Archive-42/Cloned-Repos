## Python Inequality Operator

The inequality operator (!=) does the opposite of the equality operator, as you may have already guessed.  
It means "Not Equal" and returns False where the equality operator would return True and vice versa.

```
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 2
>>> a != b
True
>>> a != 1
False
>>> a != 2
True
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**In the console there is a function named inequality with a single argument named value.**  
**The function contains an incomplete if/else statement.**  
**Complete the if statement so that the string "Not Equal to 13" will be returned when the variable is equivalent to 13.**
