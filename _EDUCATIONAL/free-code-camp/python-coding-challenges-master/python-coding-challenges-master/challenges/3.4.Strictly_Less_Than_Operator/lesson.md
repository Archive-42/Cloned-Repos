## Python Strictly Less Than Operator

The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers.  
If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns True.  
Otherwise, it returns False.

>>> a = 3
>>> b = 13
>>> a < b
True
>>> b < a
False
>>> b < 20
True
```

**_Instructions:_**    
**In the console, there is a function named strictly_less_than() that has an if-elif-else statement.**  
**In the lines with the 'if' and 'elif' clauses, fill in the less than operator and the appropriate values to make the function run properly.**
