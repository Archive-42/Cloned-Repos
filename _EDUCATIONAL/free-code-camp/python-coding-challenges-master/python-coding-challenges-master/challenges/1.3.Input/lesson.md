## Python Input

In Python 3, to get user input, use the input function and pass a string in as a parameter.
You can assign this function to a variable in order to save input.

The input() function can take numbers and words as valid answers. All input is saved as a string regardless if they are numbers!
In the example below, the input is saved to the 'school' and 'grade' variables they can be used later!

```
>>> school = input('What school do you go to?')
What school do you go to? Harvard
>>> grade = input('What grade are you in?')
What grade are you in? 4th
>>> print (school)
 Harvard
>>> print(grade)
 4th
>>>
```


**_Instructions:_**
**Prompt the user for their name and age. Print them out to console!**
