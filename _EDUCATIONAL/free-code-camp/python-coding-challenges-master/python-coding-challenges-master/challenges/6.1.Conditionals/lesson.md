## if elif else

- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise. In Python zero and null is assumed as FALSE value.
```
if value == 'some':
    print('yes')
```
An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
```
if value == 'some':
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')
```

The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.

```
if value == 'some':
   print('yes')
elif value = 'value':
   print('maybe')
else:
    print('no')
```

**Modify the value, so that program must print 'yes'.**
