## Python Maximum Value

The function max() returns the largest item in an iterable (like a list or string), or the largest of two or more arguments.  
This lesson is in the math section, so we will focus on using max() to find the largest number in a list.  
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max
```
>>> max(2, 5, 1, 4, 3)
5
>>> max(2, 5.0, 1, 4.0, 3.0)
5.0
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**The starter code has a list of numbers named, well, numbers.**  
**The variable highest is initialized to numbers.**  
**Make the value of highest equal the largest number in numbers.**
