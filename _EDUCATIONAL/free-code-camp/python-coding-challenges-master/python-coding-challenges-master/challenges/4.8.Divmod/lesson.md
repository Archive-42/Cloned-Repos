## Python divmod() Function   

Compute quotient and remainder using the divmod() function.  
The divmod() function takes two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and returns a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division.    
For integers, the result is the same as (a // b, a % b).

```
>>> divmod(1, 1)
(1, 0)
>>> divmod(3, 2)
(1, 1)
>>> divmod(3.0, 2)
(1.0, 1.0)
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**In this exercise, variables a and b are defined for you.**  
**Define a variable named result that calls the divmod() function on variables a and b (in that order).**
