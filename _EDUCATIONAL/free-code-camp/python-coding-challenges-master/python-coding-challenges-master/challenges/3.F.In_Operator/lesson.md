## Python in Operator  

Python's in operator is a type of comparison operator that tests for membership.  
The in operator evaluates to True if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and False otherwise.  
In other words, the statement 'x in y' is true if and only if the object x is found in the object y.

```
>>> x = 3
>>> y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> z = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> x in y
True
>>> x in z
False
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**In the console, there are two variables defined for you, as well as a function named membership_test().**  
**Change the variable named word from the wrong answer to one of the correct answers that will make membership_test() return True.**
