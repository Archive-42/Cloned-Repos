## Python Float Division

Python 3 distinguishes between integer (floor) division and float (true) division.  
Python uses a single forward slash (/) operator for float division.  
When using float division, even if the quotient (result) is a whole number like 1 or 2, a floating point number will be returned instead of an int.

```
>>> 1 / 1
1.0
>>> 3 / 2
1.5
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**When you run the existing code, the variable named quotient will have a value of 1.0**    
**Change the the second number (the denominator) so that quotient has a value of 2.5**
