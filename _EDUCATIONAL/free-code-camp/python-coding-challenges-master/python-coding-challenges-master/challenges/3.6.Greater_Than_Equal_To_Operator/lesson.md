## Python Greater Than or Equal To Operator  

The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers.  
If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns True.  
Otherwise, it returns False.

**_Instructions:_**   
**In the console, there is a function named greater_or_equal() that has an if-elif-else statement.**  
**In the lines with the 'if' and 'elif' clauses, fill in the greater-than-equal-to operator and the appropriate values to make the function run properly.**
