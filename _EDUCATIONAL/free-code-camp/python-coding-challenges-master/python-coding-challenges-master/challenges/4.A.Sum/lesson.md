## Python Sum

The function sum(iterable) adds all of the items in a Python iterable (list, tuple, and so on) from left to right and returns the total.  
There is an optional second argument, start, that defaults to 0 and is added to the total.  
The iterableâ€˜s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.

```
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> sum(numbers)
15
>>> sum(numbers, 1)
16
>>> sum(numbers, 10)
25
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**There are two lists of numbers.**  
**Find the sum of all of the items in both lists and assign that value to a variable named total.**
