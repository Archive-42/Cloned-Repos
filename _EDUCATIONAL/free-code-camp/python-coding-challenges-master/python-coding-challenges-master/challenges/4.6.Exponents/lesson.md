## Python Exponents

Python uses the double asterisk (\**) operator to handle exponentiation.  
The number before the asterisks is the base, and the number after is the exponent.  
Python also lets you use the built-in function pow(x, y), which gives you x to the power of y.

```
>>> 2 ** 2
4
>>> pow(2, 4)
16
>>> pow(2.0, 4)
16.0
```

**_Instructions:_**  
**In the console, you are given two variables, a and b.**  
**Using either method described in this lesson, define a variable named power that equals a to the power of b.**
