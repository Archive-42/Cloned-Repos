### Disclaimer

The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven't been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes. The overall *use* of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not.
