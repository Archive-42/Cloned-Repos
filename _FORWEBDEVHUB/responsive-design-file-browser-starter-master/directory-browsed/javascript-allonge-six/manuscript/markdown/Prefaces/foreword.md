## Foreword to the "Six" edition

ECMAScript 6 (short name: ES6; official name: ECMAScript 2015) was ratified as a standard on June 17. Getting there took a while – in a way, the origins of ES6 date back to the year 2000: After ECMAScript 3 was finished, TC39 (the committee evolving JavaScript) started to work on ECMAScript 4. That version was planned to have numerous new features (interfaces, namespaces, packages, multimethods, etc.), which would have turned JavaScript into a completely new language. After internal conflict, a settlement was reached in July 2008 and a new plan was made – to abandon ECMAScript 4 and to replace it with two upgrades:

* A smaller upgrade would bring a few minor enhancements to ECMAScript 3. This upgrade became ECMAScript 5.

* A larger upgrade would substantially improve JavaScript, but without being as radical as ECMAScript 4. This upgrade became ECMAScript 6 (some features that were initially discussed will show up later, in upcoming ECMAScript versions).

ECMAScript 6 has three major groups of features:

* Better syntax for features that already exist (e.g. via libraries). For example: classes and modules.

* New functionality in the standard library. For example:
    * New methods for strings and arrays
    * Promises (for asynchronous programming)
    * Maps and sets

* Completely new features. For example: Generators, proxies and WeakMaps.

With ECMAScript 6, JavaScript has become much larger as a language. _JavaScript Allongé, the "Six" Edition_ is both a comprehensive tour of its features and a rich collection of techniques for making better use of them. You will learn much about functional programming and object-oriented programming. And you’ll do so via ES6 code, handed to you in small, easily digestible pieces.
