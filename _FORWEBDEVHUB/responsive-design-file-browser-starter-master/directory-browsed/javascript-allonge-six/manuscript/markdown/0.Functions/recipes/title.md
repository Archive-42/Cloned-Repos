# Recipes with Basic Functions

![Before combining ingredients, begin with implements so clean, they gleam.](images/mirage.jpg)

Having looked at basic pure functions and closures, we're going to see some practical recipes that focus on the premise of functions that return functions.

### Disclaimer

The recipes are written for practicality, and their implementation may introduce JavaScript features that haven't been discussed in the text to this point, such as methods and/or prototypes. The overall *use* of each recipe will fit within the spirit of the language discussed so far, even if the implementations may not.
