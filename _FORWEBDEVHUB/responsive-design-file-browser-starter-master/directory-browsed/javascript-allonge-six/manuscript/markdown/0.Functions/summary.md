## Summary

T> ### Functions
T>
T> * Functions are values that can be part of expressions, returned from other functions, and so forth.
T> * Functions are *reference values*.
T> * Functions are applied to arguments.
T> * The arguments are passed by sharing, which is also called "pass by value."
T> * Fat arrow functions have expressions or blocks as their bodies.
T> * `function` keyword functions always have blocks as their bodies.
T> * Function bodies have zero or more statements.
T> * Expression bodies evaluate to the value of the expression.
T> * Block bodies evaluate to whatever is returned with the `return` keyword, or to `undefined`.
T> * JavaScript uses `const` to bind values to names within block scope.
T> * JavaScript uses function declarations to bind functions to names within function scope. Function declarations are "hoisted."
T> * Function application creates a scope.
T> * Blocks also create scopes if `const` statements are within them.
T> * Scopes are nested and free variable references closed over.
T> * Variables can shadow variables in an enclosing scope.
