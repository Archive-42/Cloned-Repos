## Summary

T> ### Instances and Classes
T>
T> * The `new` keyword turns any function into a *constructor* for creating *instances*.
T> * All functions have a `prototype` element.
T> * Instances behave as if the elements of their constructor's prototype are their elements.
T> * The `class` keyword acts as *syntactic sugar* for writing constructor functions.
T> * Classes created with the class keyword are actually constructor functions with optionally chained prototypes.
T> * Classes should be used in moderation, the syntax deliberately limits the flexibility and class hierarchies can lead to overly coupled code.
