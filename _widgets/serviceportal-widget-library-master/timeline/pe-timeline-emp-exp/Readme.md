## Sample Data and Data Structures
The key "show" and its value decide how many timeline events to be shown in the widget, currently its set to 2, so only 2 events are shown; to view more you need to click on the "view more" button. "timelineArray" defines the number of timeline events. We have 3 events

```javascript
var timelineData = {
  show: 2,
  header: {
    text: 'Suzy Ham',
    color: '#a7a7a7',
    remaining: 2,
    userPic: 'eb16d7c713453a007e94fc5ed144b055.iix'
  },
  timelineArray: [{
    state: 'good',
    title: 'Confirm return'
  }, {
    state: 'good',
    title: 'Sign LOA Agreement',
