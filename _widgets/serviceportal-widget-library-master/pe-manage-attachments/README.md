## Additional Information/Notes

The update set gives two ways for this function to be used. The first is a widget that is available to be used on Service portal. The second is a UI action that is put on the out of box form. A example is given in the update on the incident form.

To use on ServicePortal it requires that there be 2 parameters in the url. These parameters are sys_id and table, they can optionally be filled out in the options.
