## Additional Information/Notes
The update set installs two (2) widgets - PE Business Impact and PE Business Impact Details.
Though the PE Business Impact widget uses the PE Business Impact Details widget to display additional information about the alert anomaly, the details widget does not rely on the first widget in order to function, however; the data collected is passed to the details widget.  The PE Business Impact Details can be used separately when configured with an anomaly alert record's sys_id.
