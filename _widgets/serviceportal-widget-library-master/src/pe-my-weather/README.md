## Additional Information/Notes

- This has a simple integration to [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).
- When the widget loads, your browser will ask your permission to access current location.

- Once you grant access, widget will show weather info using your browser location.
- If you choose not to grant access, the widget will use location in sys_user table to fetch the weather

## Installation

Download and install update set **[pe-my-weather.u-update-set.xml](https://github.com/platform-experience/serviceportal-widget-library/blob/master/src/pe-my-weather/pe-my-weather.u-update-set.xml)**

## Configuration

- I have included a demo API key for use as part of the update set. It is advised to sign up and get your own API key from here [https://openweathermap.org/api'](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Once you have your own API key, you can switch out the demo key by changing the System property called **openweathermap.apikey**
