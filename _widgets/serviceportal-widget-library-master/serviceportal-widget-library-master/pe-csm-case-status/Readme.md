# PE CSM Case Status

## Description

This widget can be used to create a simple card to show the status of a incident/case.

Driven by **sn_customerservice_case** and **task_sla** tables, when a case sysid is provided in the Widget Schema options, the widget will fetch details from the record and the associated SLA for display.
