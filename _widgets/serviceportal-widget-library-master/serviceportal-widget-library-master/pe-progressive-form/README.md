# Progressive Form

## Description

This widget allows you to offer users a form submission experience which progresses through sections, rather than just showing them all at once. It also allows you to create related records directly from the same form.

Features:

- Works with new and existing records.
- Supports any record which has a “one to many” relationship. E.g. one Problem record can be linked to many Incident records. In this scenario, Problem would be the Master record, and Incident would be the Child record.
- UI Policy, UI Scripts, and Form Layouts are supported as per the out of box form widget.

**NOTE:** this widget only works with Jakarta and later releases.

## Additional Information/Notes
- This widget creates numbered ”Concertina” panels for each form section, plus an additional final panel for the child (related) records. The final panel also contains the submit button.
- As with the out of box "Form" widget, use the `sys_id` URL parameter to specify the record to open. Not supplying this parameter will result in a new master record being created upon submission of the form.
- Ensure the tables your editing have corresponding server-side UI Actions with the appropriate action names.
