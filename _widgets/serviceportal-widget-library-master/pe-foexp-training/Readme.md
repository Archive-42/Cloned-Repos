## Configuration
---
This widget uses 4 new custom tables. All are accessible under the new "Training" module.

#### _Categories_
This is a group of training courses which are all displayed in the widget together.

These are stored in the `u_pe_training_category` table.

#### _Courses_
These are stored in the `u_pe_training_course` table.

#### _Prerequisites_
This allows you to link courses together and says that, for example, "Training Course A" must be completed before "Training Course B" is started.

These are stored in the `u_pe_training_prerequisites` table.

#### _Assignments_
The current user must be assigned a course for it to show up in the widget.

These are stored in the `u_pe_training_assignments_list` table.
