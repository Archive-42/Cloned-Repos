## Additional Information/Notes
The update set installs two (2) widgets - PE Root Cause and PE Root Cause Details.
Though the PE Root Cause widget uses the PE Root Cause Details widget to display additional information about the alert anomaly, the details widget does not rely on the first widget in order to function.  The PE Root Cause Details can be used separately when configured with an anomaly alert record's sys_id.
