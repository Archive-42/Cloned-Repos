This is a collection of .py Python projects created using the TKinter library.

Tkinter-animation.py is a simple animation created using solely polygonal coordinates and RGB manipulation, displaying a scene with a piano player in the foreground and weather cycling between sunny and rainy through the window in the background. Color gradients were also used to alter lighting effects.

Tkinter-Tron-GUI.py is a game created in a similar fashion to the previous program. This allows two players to interact with Tron bikes using the AWSD and IJKL keys, respectively. Each player receives points for causing the other player to either run into a wall or collide with one of the generated color trails. An invinsibility powerup also exists, randomly generated on a timer as a strobing circle that either player can collide with to activate.

Tkinter-Grocery-Calculator.py is the first python program I created, also relying on the Tkinter library. This program uses a series of text input windows to allow a user to add up the costs of various supermarket items based on the cost and quantity of each good. When finished, the program will calculate the total cost based on a user defined tax rate.
